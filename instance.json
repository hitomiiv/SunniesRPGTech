          "body": "**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_HEADER.webp)**\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER1.webp)**\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is a mod that adds new and improved villages and pillager outposts to Minecraft.** It is available for both Forge and Fabric, and it works with most world-generation and structure mods. CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\nChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods. Full documentation is [here](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility)\n\nIt also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem.\nMods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n- **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n- **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n- **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default.\n- Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the CurseForge website.\n\nMod integration\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it's compatible. If it isn't yet, It will be. Read this [wiki page](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility) for details!\n\nYou can suggest more mods in my GitHub Issue section.\n</details>\n\n\n![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER5.webp)\n\n[![discord-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/discord-plural_64h.png)](https://discord.gg/JzYEw7PxQv) \n[![github-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/github-plural_64h.png)](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village) \n[![twitter-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/twitter-plural_64h.png)](https://twitter.com/ChoiceTheorem)\n[![youtube-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/youtube-plural_64h.png)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUSv0t-aWToQkpP5eonHmlA)\n\n**Credits**\n-----------\n\n*   Vichy0623 for codesigning the builds\n*   Robified for converting this datapack into a mod.\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_PROMO.webp)](https://bisecthosting.com/CT)",

In between continents are plenty of islands to keep your sailing interesting. When you spawn in your world, you are guarenteed to always spawn on a medium-sized continent, which averages around 1k blocks in size.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

This is important!\n\nThe version support numbers are strict! <br>\nIf a version says it supports MC 1.18.1 it will NOT work on 1.18.2! <br>\n\nAnd: the mod is still in alpha. Things may change, break, crash or otherwise go wrong. You have been warned! <br>\nAlthough if you have problems feel free to leave an issue on the project's GitLab.\n<br> \n \n\n \n## FAQ:\n\n**Q: Forge or Fabric?** <br>\nA: MC 1.20.6 and newer - NeoForge and Fabric are both in the same jar. <br>\nMC 1.20.4 and older - Forge and Fabric are both in the same jar. \n\n**Q: Shaders?** <br>\nA: Yes, but only with certain shaders. <br>\n- Optifine: DH partially works with forward rendered shaders.\n- Iris (and equivalent ports): DH 2.1.0+ only works with Iris 1.7+ and only with shaders built with DH support in mind. \n  - DH 2.0 and older don't work with Iris.\n\n**Q: Does this work with player created structures?** <br>\nA: Yes.\n\n**Q: Is there multiplayer support?** <br>\nA: Yes.\nAlthough currently the mod is only client side so you have to explore chunks for the mod to use them.\n\n<br>\n\n### Extended FAQ:\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/1-general/General\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-general.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/2-problems-and-solutions/Problems-and-Solutions\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-mod-support.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/4-mod-support/Mod-Support\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-problem.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a>\n\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Discord:\nJoin our Discord for news, updates, and help:\ndiscord.com/invite/xAB8G4cENx\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Support us:\n\nIf you want to help with development, join our discord and let us know!\n\nOtherwise if you can't help with development but still want to support Distant Horizons, check out our donation page:\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/distanthorizons",

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).\n\nThe downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods` folder.",

Helps in maintaining sanity :)<br><br>Initially created to hide the warning in my own development environment, and thought it couldn't hurt to release it as a feature for in production as well.

This is __not__ required, but it allows all items to have their own beautiful textures.\n- Incendium is **not** compatible with Amplified Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nIncendium adds 8 unique biomes to the nether. Do you bravely venture through the perilous **Quartz Flats**, wander the mysterious **Withered Forest**, or battle your way through the steep **Infernal Dunes**? Each biome has a unique personality and story to tell. With unique block themes in each biomes, opportunities for new farms for technical players, 3D biomes, and stunning terrain, there is truly something for everyone.\n\n### Structures\nTo compliment the lovely biomes, there are 9+ structures for you to explore and conquer. In the Ash Barrens, the **Foribdden Castle** stands forbodingly, with courageous Piglins defending its treasured loot - one of the largest and complex random structures in Minecraft! Alternatively, you can conquer the ominous **Sanctum** with its illagers defending dark secrets and strong weapons. The skeleton chef Torte defends his **Quartz Kitchen**, and the Withered Director his **Nether Reactor**. What will you conquer first?\n\n### Items\nEvery mob you defeat and structure you conquer has its reward - Incendium pays you handsomely with both rick loot and custom weapons! Defeating the Hovering Inferno could earn you the **Trailblazer** - a flame-spewing bow. A high damage, but taxing **Greatsword of Sacrifice** hides within the Forbidden Castle's walls, along with the helpful **Hefty Pickaxe**. Or maybe you prefer to find the **Hazmat Suit** to protect you from all types of poisonous attacks. There are over 25 items to forge your own playstyle with!\n\n### Mobs\nNo datapack would be complete without its own mobs to fight you. The Toxic Heap is home of the agile **Toxic Slimes**, and the Withered Forest is haunted by the **Restless Spirits**. On the other hand, you could go on a rescue missue to save the **Ghastling** from the Abandoned Tower - in return, it will defend you from Ghasts. If none of this is challenging, you can summon the all-powerful **Hovering Inferno** boss for a difficult and dirty battle.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

So many things broke in 1.20.5, and it was simply not worth my time. Thank you!\n\n- Updated to 1.20.5 (supports 1.20-1.20.6)\n- Now supports Neoforge\n- Scout's Battle Helm now uses an emerald Sentry trim\n- Custom banners and potions have been renamed, or given a name if there was not one already\n- Custom banners and potions are now split into their own loot tables for easier use\n- New particles for Necrotic and Radiation shields, and they should trigger their effects properly\n- In 1.20.5 only, Ghastling now appears as a mini-Ghast\n- Voltaic Trident should now work properly\n- Holy Wrath is removed from a loot table it shouldn't have been in\n- Fixed issue where Piglin Villagers would not move\n- Greatsword of Sacrifice's self-damage has been rebalanced\n- Restless Spirits *should* no longer starve to death\n- Fixed issue where a new marker entity would generate on every single world load\n- Fixed a malformed JSON strings that could spawm console on Spigot-based servers",

          "description": "Sodium addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo",
          "body": "Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.",

You against the void - nothing more than that.\nNullscape boosts the End's height to 384 blocks, and makes full use of 1.18's modern features to generate incredibly varied terrain. You'll find everything from shattered islands, to floating valleys, to crystallized peaks! Different regions of the End - on very large scales - have different properties and feelings to allow for almost infinite variation in terrain shapes. From sponge-like porous terrain, to stretched alien landscapes, to stacked rounded islands; you'll find new and interesting terrain no matter how far you go.\n__ __\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n",

The loot is designed to support entering and surviving on the first day you create your world.\n\n## Vanilla-like\n\nA key objective of this mod is to stick to vanilla blocks, entities, items, and mechanics. Meaning that everything that's added is something which could also be built in vanilla creative.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nRoguelike Dungeons started as a project to enhance and build on the experience of the original Minecraft box style dungeons by linking rooms together with corridors and stairwells.\n\nThe design of these dungeons was inspired by the 404 Challenge, and Vechs' SuperHostile maps. Amnesia the Dark Descent inspired the tone and themes throughout.\n\nThe title comes from the genre of old dungeon crawlers by the same name.\n\n## Roguelike Challenge\n\nTry to enter a dungeon on your first day and don't leave until you've explored the entire structure. The loot and difficulty are designed to make this a rewarding experience.\n\n## Commands and Gamerules\n\nRoguelike Dungeons generate in the world naturally, however you can directly control the placement if you wish.\n\nThe \"roguelike\" command can be used to generate a dungeon at the caller's position by calling \"roguelike dungeon here\". This command will be expanded later.\n\nThe \"roguelikeDungeonsGenerate\" Gamerule (defaults to true) can be used to disable natural generation.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why beta? Is this mod stable?\nThis mod is stable as far as I know. I'll remove the beta status when core systems are no longer under construction. Soon.\n\n### How do I find the dungeon? Does locate work?\nThe locate command does not work because these dungeons are not generated as part of the vanilla structure system. You'll usually find them near villages, so locate those instead.\n\n### Can I add this mod to an existing world?\nYes. New dungeons will naturally spawn in new chunks. If you want to add a dungeon to old terrain you can do so using the \"roguelike\" command.\n\n### What happens if I remove this mod?\nNothing will break if you remove this mod after generating dungeons. Mob Spawners will no longer generate fancy mob equipment, and that's about it.\n\n### Do players who join a multiplayer world need to have this mod installed?\nNo. This mod is entirely vanilla compatible, and does not need to be installed on the client side.\n\n### Can I add this mod to a modpack?\nYes. Do whatever you like.\n\n### Can I change the loot?\nCurrently, no. Eventually I'll add a vanilla style loot table option.\n\n### Can I add my own rooms?\nNo, this dungeon is generated procedurally. It's not possible to add content without changing the source code. If it were easy to add this capability I would.\n",

          "body": "**This mod is the result of thousands of hours of development, and is made possible thanks to players like you.** If you would like to show a token of your appreciation for my work, and help support the development of Sodium in the process, then consider [buying me a coffee](https://jellysquid.me/donate).\n\n<a href=\"https://caffeinemc.net/donate\"><img src=\"https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3\" width=\"180\"/></a>\n\n---\n\n<center>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/5ca2e8f6c72f3d543dd3dc95b706964c5678d80e.png\" alt=\"Sodium 0.4 Comparison\"></img>\n <p>\n   <!-- This paragraph is load bearing, and ensures a margin is added before the following Markdown -->\n </p>\n</center>\n\nSodium is a powerful rendering engine and optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves performance and graphical quality. It boasts great compatibility with the wider mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is available for multiple mod loaders, but we recommend using [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) for the most simple and lightweight experience. If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed your mod loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.",

          "body": "![Tectonic logo](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/3797bb32f05af523d3ec2a76b6c3c4f9187fac50.png)\n\nWelcome to **Tectonic**, a world generation project that aims to transform how terrain is shaped.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nTectonic is available as a datapack and as a Fabric/Neoforge mod. Forge mod versions are discontinued starting with 1.20.5.\n\nIf you are using Terralith with Tectonic **as datapacks**, install [Terratonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terratonic) instead of Tectonic. If you are using the two projects **as mods**, you don't need to install anything extra.\n\n## Description\n\nTectonic makes several large, impactful changes to worldgen.\n\nFeatures labeled with 🎚️ can be toggled on and off in the mod version's config file.\n\n### Mountain Ranges\n\nThe way mountains generate has been completely overhauled, with them forming huge mountain ranges that can stretch for thousands of blocks. These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\nThe mod version's config file provides several options for customizing mountain generation:\n- `terrain_scale`: Vertically scales terrain, higher values = more extreme terrain heights\n- `horizontal_mountain_scale`: Horizontally scales mountains, lower values = less steep mountain slopes\n- `increased_height`: Enables a built-in datapack that increases the Overworld build and generation height to 640\n\n### Underground Rivers 🎚️\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn some steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as \"lerp\" issues - is gone. In previous Tectonic versions this meant that Windswept biomes were removed from generation, but in v2 and above they will once again generate.\n\n### Dunes 🎚️\n\nSmooth desert dunes will generate in some Desert biomes, giving Deserts a special look to them.\n\n### Deeper Oceans 🎚️\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!\n\nIf the mod version is installed, vanilla Ocean Monuments will generate deeper to compensate for the deeper oceans.\n",

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

          "body": "# Welcome to William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld for 1.20.1 and higher!\n\n![William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54945257/205379797-def647a9-8d28-4c90-80b9-08d8a4a0e082.png)\n\n## Introduction\nThis mod attempts to recreate the familiar landscapes you know and love in a way that creates a more realistic and atmospheric world.\n\n### Why are there now 2 WWOO versions?\nWe decided to split WWOO in two parts, one with new biomes added ([Expanded Exosphere](https://modrinth.com/mod/expanded-ecosphere)) and one which only overhauls existing biomes (WWOO).\n\n## Key Features\n### Overhauled Biomes\nEvery biome has been reworked to provide a more realistic and immersive environment. Say goodbye to the standard biomes and welcome an enhanced world filled with diverse landscapes and exciting adventures.\n\n### Biome Transitions\nDiscover the new transitions between biomes, that eliminate jarring shifts between environments, allowing for a more natural world flow. Check out this [example picture](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/II7t6llZ/images/415ed50637330b1c39d463076af7f2ab5fe9a283.png) in the Gallery.\n\n### Compatibility with Vanilla Clients\nWorried about compatibility issues with your friends? Fear not! Overhauled Overworld exclusively uses vanilla blocks, ensuring that you can install this mod on your server, and your friends can join with their vanilla clients. This makes for a hassle-free and enjoyable multiplayer experience.\n\n## Enhance Your Experience\n- **Navigable Rivers**: Improve your river experience with this travel-friendly add-on. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/navigable-rivers-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-2/)\n\n- **Cliffs and Coves**: Improve your world with better coastlines using this add-on. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/cliffs-and-coves-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-2/)\n\n- **Towering Tepuis**: Add a forbidding and mysterious area of adventure to your world. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towering-tepuis-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-4-1-20-6/)\n\nIf you prefer a datapack over a mod, click [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/4pbhwMQz) to download the datapack version of WWOO.\n\n\n## Join Our Community\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect with fellow adventurers, we invite you to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/yJng7sC44x).

Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work. Feel free to ask me any questions on Discord!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"http://sbisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3wUhXJJ.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Nether Fortresses is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-ocean-monuments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Ocean Monuments</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Witch Huts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-witch-huts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Witch Huts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li>Infernal Expansion, Better Nether & other Nether biome mods</li>\n<li>Apocalyptic Fortress: The AF fortress will spawn alongside the Better Fortress</li>\n<li>Bygone Nether: Better Fortresses will spawn instead of Bygone Nether's enhanced vanilla fortress</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it! Seriously!</p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3LW5j7DAdE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zMhFcqM.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better End Island is intended to be compatible with as many mods as possible.

Everything should still work properly though.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Progressive Bosses</b><ul><li>Extra cage placement may be a little scuffed in older versions of Progressive Bosses. Make sure you're on the latest version!</li><li><i>/end_island reset</i> command may not properly reset fight history/progress on Progressive Bosses' side of things. If you use this command, you should also run <i>/progressivebosses difficulty set <player> dragon 0</i></li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Better End</b><ul><li>Since the island is smaller than in vanilla, obsidian spikes will spawn closer to the center</li><li>If any spikes are missing or you have any other issues with generation, try using the <i>/end_island reset</i> command while in the End</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Nullscape</b><ul><li>Completely compatible on 1.19+. <b>Not compatible on 1.18.2.</b></li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Savage Ender Dragon</b><ul><li>The crystals Better End Island adds in the center may rarely respawn, if crystal respawning from Savage Ender Dragon is enabled.

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility. However, mods trying to change the same mechanics will never be compatible (such as dual wielding mods).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## 🤝 Partnerships\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWe partnered up with the following mods, to fully utilise the JSON API of Better Combat:\n\n- [MC Dungeons Weapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdw)\n\n- [MCDoom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdoom)\n\n- [MedievalWeapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/medievalweapons)\n\n- [Mythic Metals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mythicmetals)\n\n- [Simply Swords](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-swords)\n\n- [Spectrum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spectrum)",

You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.",

This is the same mod written by genandnic of [Wall Jump](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wall-jump-fabric), but it's for 1.19.4.\n\n<font size=\"10\">\nWall-to-wall platforming in Minecraft! \n</br></br>\n<font size=+1>\n\nWith this mod installed, players can perform new movements that will allow them to navigate their environment more dynamically.\n\nWall jumping allows players to jump off walls to gain additional height or reach areas that might otherwise be out of reach. To perform a wall jump, the player must jump towards a wall and then jump again off of the wall at the right moment. Timing is crucial, as the player must hit the wall at the correct angle and jump off at the right time to gain the maximum height.\n\nDouble jumping allows players to jump twice in quick succession, providing even more mobility and allowing them to reach even higher places. To perform a double jump, the player must jump once, then jump again while still in midair. This technique is helpful in reaching higher ledges or avoiding obstacles in the player's path.\n\nPlease see the following on how to do the various actions ingame!\n\n<b>Wall Cling</b>: Jump towards a wall and hold the wall jump key (LSHIFT). \n\n<b>Wall Jump</b>: While wall clinging, keep holding W and let go of LSHIFT to wall jump.\n\n<b>Double Jump</b>: Optional mid-air jump that you can use to your advantage.\n\n</font></font></font></font></center>",

Simply hold the \"excavate\" key(bound to ~ by default,configurable) while mining a block and all the connected blocks will be mined as well, saving you the time from mining each individually.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/fAD8Jrt4HVqn8BEHF2/giphy.gif \"\")\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/WTRhcX7JxVw2mpIiUW/giphy.gif \"\")\n\nDiggus Maximus is highly configurable, featuring:\n\n*   Automatically picking up the mined blocks\n*   maximum number of blocks to mine\n*   max distance from start block to spread\n*   the ability to excavate with your hand\n*   Tool durability\n*   Player exhaustion\n*   A blacklist/whitelist\n*  Auto stopping before tool breaks\n*  Support for mining BlockTags\n\nDiggus Maximus is required to be installed on both the client, and the server. While playing on a server, the server config will override the clients \n\n",

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at [@BlayTheNinth](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth).",

The book is still WIP and has no recipe, but you can get and read it in creative mode  \n- [NoMoreGlowingPotions](https://modrinth.com/mod/nomoreglowingpots) is highly suggested to appreciate the actual potion colors, instead of the weird glowing effect that makes them all look the same.  \n\n## Potions and Recipes\n  \n  \nEvery single potion recipe can be individually disabled in the config file.  \nAll potions in this mod are brewed in the vanilla Brewing Stand with vanilla items and have the standard splash, lingering and arrow variants; some of them may also have redstone and glowstone enhancements.  \nNot all potions are available in fabric yet. I'm slowly working on it, don't worry!  \n \n## Brewing Stand Tweak\n  \n  \nThere are two kind of people in this world, those who like the blaze powder requirement for brewing stands, and those who don't. I belong to the latter. A config now allows brewing stands to be powered by a fire underneath, or really anything made of fire/lava material. It is kinda slow, but I feel like it is a good compromise for fuel, it makes so much more sense to me. Note that blaze powder will still work, this is just an alternative. The option can be turned off in the config.  \nHeat sources and conductive materials can be specified through the tags `extraalchemy:heat_source` and `extraalchemy:heat_conductor`.\n \n## Vials\n  \n  \nVials are my version of a stackable potion system. Craft a splash potion with an empty vial to get a vial of the potion, or right click an empty vial to fill with the first potion found in your inventory. Vials apply the effect on the player immediately and can be stacked up to 16. To craft an empty vial make the same recipe of a glass bottle in the bottom rows and put a flint in the top-center slot.\n\n## Potion Bag\n\n\nThe potion bag is a handy way to carry around your potions. You can store any drinkable brew inside, and select one type to have quick access to. To access the bag interface shift-right click the bag. Using a simple right click will administer the potion, or it will select the next available type when you run out of the selected one.  \nA keybind can be used while holding a bag to decide what happens when a potion runs out: deselect everything, select next potion, or keep unavailable potion selected.  \nYou can also dye them like leather armor! (They should retain their settings and inventory in doing so, too)\n\n## Potion Rings\n\n\nThe potion rings are a way to have a semi-persistent potion effect. Combine an empty ring with any valid vanilla potion to get the corresponding ring.   \nThis feature can be disabled or configured through the config file.  \nThe ring will apply the potion over time to the wearer, and every available potion is customized to allow different xp costs for more powerful potions.  \nEvery potion also has a customized duration when applied, and XP cost and renewal time can be defined separatedly (aka: no more flashing night vision potion, as the renewal time is at 18s, making the potion go from 36s to 18s, instead of waiting for it to go all the way to 0).  \nNew potions with custom XP cost, level, duration and renewal time can be defined through the vanilla recipe system which is automatically fetched from the server on connection. [Example](https://github.com/zabi94/ExtraAlchemy/tree/1.16-fabric/src/main/resources/data/extraalchemy/recipes/ring_recipes).  \nUsing the same name of a mod-defined json, and setting the output to be a \"useless potion\" (water/awkward/mundane/thick...) will disable that ring.  \nWhen Trinkets is installed, rings will work in the ring slot!  \nYou can create your own rings through [this tool](https://zabi94.dev/ring_gen/)\n\n\n## Potion Tooltip Icons\n\nSince 1.18.2 there's the option to see the potion icons on the tooltips of potion-bearing items, like drinking/splash/lingering potions, tipped arrows, vials, potion rings and loaded potion bags:\n\n![potion icon image](https://zabi94.dev/mc_screenshots/tooltip_icons.png)\n\n\n## Bug Support\n  \n1) Install the latest available version for your minecraft version and try again   \n2) If the bug still persist, open a new issue **on Github**  \n\n\n \n## Will you port to...?\n  \n- Past versions: No. Stop asking.\n- Future versions: Sure, on fabric, when I have time. Keep in mind I have a life and a full time job.\n- Forge: No. [Gretchen, stop trying to make Forge happen, it's not going to happen](https://youtu.be/Pubd-spHN-0?t=2). Not even if someone else offers. _I don't want to_ have a forge version.\n\n\n## Currently supported versions:  \n- 1.19.2 and before: No  \n- **1.19.3**: Supported  \n- **1.20 snapshots**: development will begin shortly\n\n\n## Modpack policy\n  \n  \nYou can redistribute the jar **as part of modpacks** if you include a link redirecting to either this page or Curseforge's page.   \n\nDo not redistribute the mod as a single jar, please.\n\nAt the current time, multiple websites are violating this policy, so if you downloaded the mod from them or you visualized their ad-gates, you are actively supporting this practice; please, try to access the files from the original source.  \nJust to mention a few that you should avoid:  \n\n- minecraft-forum .net\n- 9minecraft .net\n- ign .com\n- 8minecraft .com\n- 9minecraft-mods.blogspot .it\n- minecraft-inside .ru\n\n[Read more here!](http://stopmodreposts.org) (You can also download and install a browser plugin from this link, it will help you block malicious sites)\n\n\n\n*Thanks to Vazkii and wiiv for kindly providing the original textures for the potion effects, and to she_is_long for reworking all of them (+item textures) to the new Minecraft art style! &lt;3*\n\n ",

It provides many of the same features as [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) while many new conveniences, like server-client config synchronization, added on top\n\n - A fully automatic [registration system](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/registration/) that is designed to be as generic as possible. It is simple and non-verbose to use for basic registries, yet the underlying API tree is flexible and can also be used for many custom registration solutions\n\n - [Item Group extensions](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/item-groups/) which allow for sub-tabs inside your mod's group as well as a host of other features like custom buttons, textures and item variant handling\n\n - A fully-featured [networking layer](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/networking/) with fully automatic serialization, handshaking to ensure client compatibility and a built-in solution for triggering parametrized particle events in a side-agnostic manner\n\n - Client-sided particle helpers that allow for easily composing multi-particle effects\n\n - Rich text translations, allowing you to use Minecraft's text component format in your language files to provide styled text without any code\n\n***\n\nowo is documented in two main ways:\n\n - There is rich, detailed JavaDoc throughout the entire codebase\n - There is a wiki with in-depth explanations and tutorials for most of owo's features over at https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/features/",

In its base configuration it serves as an easy way to increase ore yield, but everything is data-driven allowing you to add new forges and recipes as you please. These data-driven features are mostly intended for mod and modpack authors, especially because new forge types can only be added through other mod-datapacks or global configuration files. \n\n\n---\n\nBy default there are three forge tiers, each with different fuel capacity and speed. They're all made from different stone-like materials, you can look them up on the wiki.\n\n![Forge Tutorial](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/0ca4651a23fb13f1add7bed2820bfb2059e3e2bc.png)\n \n\nAll controllers are crafted according to this pattern, with the outer ring of blocks corresponding to that controller's material. To construct a forge, simply follow the convenient guide above this piece of text using any combination of blocks that forge type supports.\n\n​\n\n<center><img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5df27e031fe7bba7fd361683dbe662c95633d7bb.png\" /></center>\n\n![GUI](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/8c88d3b6f3d3286efb83b29bb772eba52372f7fc.png)\n\n## Development Discord:\nJoin this is if you have any issues or need help adding new content\n\n[![Discord](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/372/487/wraith.png)](http://discord.gg/Pa5wDVm8Xv)",

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n### Credits\n\nIn certain older versions, this library used to bundle typetools; you can find its license [here](https://github.com/jhalterman/typetools/blob/master/LICENSE.txt \"\")",

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n",

          "body": "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochotonida/artifacts/1.18/src/main/resources/logo.png)\n\nSome older versions of this mod can be found on curseforge: [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts) /  [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts-fabric)\n\nArtifacts is a mod which aims to make exploration more rewarding by adding various powerful items that cannot be crafted.\n\nThe items added by this mod can be found in chests in vanilla structures, through archaeology, or can very rarely be found worn by entities. All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items and their descriptions can be found in the images tab. Sn up-to-date list of where each item can be found is available on the wiki on GitHub.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack. Information about the data formats used can be found on the [Trinkets wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Trinkets-Data-Formats).\n\n#### _Which mod are you using to put artifacts on armor stands?_\n\n[Curious Armor Stands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curious-armor-stands \"\").\n\n#### _Can I still find artifacts if I add this mod to a world that has already been generated?_\n\nCampsites and mimics will only spawn in chunks that were generated after you downloaded the mod. You will still be able to find artifacts in unopened chests in existing chunks.\n\n#### [Forge] _Whey I try to open the Curios menu to equip my artifacts, nothing happens._\n\nSome server plugins can cause this (https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/issues/131). If you're using plugins, verify that this issue also happens in a Forge-only environment before asking for help.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/298798089068609537/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/87pXJadaRr)",

This allows the player to gain the benefits of the totem without the hassle of needing to remember to\nhold the totem or the need to sacrifice a useful hotbar/inventory slot to keep one around.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n",

While the elytra is in this slot, it will grant the same flight capabilities as if it was in your chestplate slot.

          "body": "Radiant Gear is a mod that acts as a simple compatibility bridge between [Curios API](https://modrinth.com/mod/curios) or [Trinkets API](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) and dynamic light mods. With this mod, items in accessory slots will inherit the dynamic lighting behavior defined by the\ndynamic lighting mod. As an example, if a held torch would provide dynamic lighting, then installing this mod will cause\ntorches placed in accessory slots to also provide dynamic lighting.\n\n**Please note: This mod does NOT add any content or slots on its own. In order to gain more slots or assign items into\nslots, users will need to either add a mod that adds that kind of content or add it themselves through the [Curios\nAPI configuration](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users) or the [Trinkets API configuration](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide).**\n\n**Compatible Mods**\n\n- [Dynamic Lights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-lights)\n- [Lucent](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lucent)\n- [Magnesium/Rubidium Dynamic Lights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamiclights-reforged)\n- [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau)\n- [RyoamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/ryoamiclights)\n- [Embeddium++](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddiumplus)\n- [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights)\n\nNote: This mod's sidedness depends on the dynamic lighting mod used. For example, if using Lucent then this mod is\nclient-side only because Lucent is client-side only. On the other hand, if using Dynamic Lights then this mod is\nrequired on both client and server because Dynamic Lights is required on both as well.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n",

Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://optifine.alternatives.lambdaurora.dev/)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire! Fire! Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p style=\"color: red\">Please, when you write the name of this mod, don't add spaces.</p>**\n\n[fabric]: https://fabricmc.net\n[Mod loader: Fabric]: https://img.shields.io/badge/modloader-Fabric-1976d2?style=flat-square&logo=data:image/png;base64,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\n[Fabric API]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api \"Fabric API CurseForge page\"\n[ModMenu]: https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu\n[Sodium]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium \"Sodium CurseForge page\"\n[Canvas]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer \"Canvas CurseForge page\"\n[LambdAurora Discord]: https://discord.gg/abEbzzv\n",

The **current season** is defined by the **world time** (using `/time set 0` will reset to day 1 of spring). Each season has its own changes; during the spring, biomes will mostly try to match their original characteristics.\n\nThe mod has 2 components:\n- **Server:** If installed on the server biomes will have different temperatures. (this enables weather changes like snowing and block freezing in the winter). The server component also contains seasonal crops, allowing crops to grow at different speeds according to the season.\n- **Client:** If installed on the client biomes will have different colormaps according to the current season. This is just a visual change and it'll not physically impact your world in any form.\n\nTo get the full experience it's recommended that you install the mod on both the server and the client.\n\n### Seasonal Biomes\n\nBiomes have **different temperatures** depending on the current **season**:\n\n- Cold Biomes will have rain in the summer\n- Temperate Biomes will have snow in the winter\n- Tropical Biomes will have a steady season all year round\n- Hot Biomes will have a rainy season in the winter\n\nDepending on the **original** temperature/precipitation of the **biome**, this behavior can change. \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdYBkgC.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gH5seb5.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qs600XR.gif\">\n</center>\n\n### Seasonal Crops\n\nCrops will grow at **different speeds** depending on the current **season**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75gqPqS.png\">\n</center>\n\nEach **individual crop** will have a **pre-configured** growth **speed** for one of the four seasons, this is controlled by a **datapack** and can be changed by the user if they want.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dR4OYPT.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)",

An item that **scans** the right-clicked **block** and shows what season is currently affecting it.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nApart from the greenhouse resources, Fabric Seasons: Extras adds **other blocks** such as:\n- Season Detector - **Redstone component** that outputs a redstone **signal** based on the **current season** and the block's configuration.\n- Season Calendar - Helpful **item/black** that can show you the season **progress** and how many **days** are left until the next season.\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)",

By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) to help you learn the basics!\n\n \n**📝 FAQ**\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q. How does this different from the other existing Farmer's Delight Fabric?**\n\nA. This port's main focus has been on simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod. This meant that only minor changes were made to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\nPackage names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This means that FD addons can now easily be ported from Forge to Fabric with, ideally, no change at all as all the package names are the same.\n\n[A list of differences can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Differences.md)\n\n**Q. Will existing addons work for this?**\n\nA. While porting existing Forge addons to Fabric will be trivial, already existing Fabric addons made for the old Fabric port will NOT work and they will have to update to reflect the new package structure.\n\n[A list of supported addons and integrations can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Addons_And_Integrations.md)\n\nFeel free to ask for more compat layers, however, they will only be done if they are simple enough to be able to be done, anything more complicated and you're best to wait for a developer to support Farmer's Delight Refabricated or just accept that they might not, it's really up to them.\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Will I keep old blocks from the other FD port?**\n\nA. The mods use the same IDs so yes.\n\n**Q. Will addons for the other port be updated to use this one instead?**\n\nA. That depends on them. Updating/porting a Forge addon is trivial but this will still take a bit of time and depends on the individual modder. So please be patient and don't harrass modders.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight Refabricated is currently being updated for 1.20+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No. This mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\nPlease, do NOT ask for backports!\n</details>",

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing a Recipe Viewer mod. Create has full support for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>, <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/rei\">REI</a>, and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\">EMI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create/issues\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qPmjSXy.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrKV2QTuyGcv4E3eSJpBiYA/playlists\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/L1bU9mr.png\" width=\"160\" /></a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/hmaD7Se\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uf6V9ZX.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Supporting-the-Project\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fHQ45KR.png\" width=\"227\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Development\n\n<p>Find out about supported versions and what's currently in the works in <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/dev.status\">this dedicated wiki page.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Developers\n\n<p>simibubi, Jozufozu, Pepper, Zelophed, gamez7, Grimmauld, Snownee</p>\n\n### Porters\n\n<p>Pepper, Tropheus Jay, AlphaMode, smellypengu, Aeiou, Whangd00dle, YTG123</p>\n\n### Artists\n\n<p>Kryppers, voxel_dani, LeastReality, vectorwing</p>\n\n### Special thanks to\n\n<p>tterrag, evanthebruce, D'Arcy Olla</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Localization\nTranslations may be unfinished or out of date.\n\n* en_us (English US)\n* de_de (German) by Vexatos, Azratosh, SaurierZockt, DreiMu, muffinbarde, Peatral\n* nl_nl (Dutch) by Prusias\n* fr_fr (French) by Kiro, dindin-glitch\n* zh_cn (Chinese) by TUsama, BigDaleAHA, gloomybanana, Snownee, MacrousHyucen, Demonese, StarFish\n* zh_tw (Chinese, Traditional) by dunois\n* ru_ru (Russian) by sqcode06, Hanqnero, sirabein, pgkrol, Alepod\n* pt_br (Brazilian) by lucassabreu, vyhi\n* jp_jp (Japanese) by MORIMORI0317, CKenJa, RakuGaki-MC\n* ko_kr (Korean) by qkrehf2, red1854th\n* it_it (Italian) by Masterlupo, Chexet48\n* es_es (Spanish) by FrannDzs, muriplz\n* es_mx (Spanish, Mexico) by JohanIvan\n* es_cl (Spanish, Chile) by Alonsinwhat\n* pl_pl (Polish) by joker876\n* ro_ro (Romanian) by andreutu",

This Minecraft mod is written for\nthe Fabric & Quilt mod loaders for modern versions of Minecraft (1.18.2+) - Changes tend to focus on making it more\nextendable, as well as improving compatibility with other mods. Improvements to older features are also being sprinkled\nin from time to time.\n\nThis mod's official project pages can be found below:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod-fabric)\n- [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-restitched) \n\nFabric compatibility *comes first* due to its current adoption in the Minecraft Modding community, however Quilt is\nsupported by the mod currently! In the case that either Mod Loader encounters a problem, make sure to\n[submit a bug report!](https://github.com/squeeglii/grapplemod-restitched)\n\n\n\n## 🔗 Origins\n\nThis repository is an unofficial fork of Yyon's [Grappling Hook Mod](https://github.com/yyon/grapplemod), which was \nwritten to support the Forge mod loader. It has a history stretching back all the way to its MCreator roots in 2015,\nimplementing improved physics, upgrades, and better integrations since.\n\nYou can find the links to its official project pages (and the downloads) here:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod/versions)\n- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-mod) (More up-to-date? Last checked 19/6/23)\n\nThis fork's root stems from the 1.19.2 version of v13, created under the original scope of providing an alternative\nunder the Fabric & Quilt ecosystems, as well as updating these ports to future versions. With the original scope met,\nfuture versions now focus on enhancements on top of the original work, as well as perpetual support into the future.\n\n\n## ☎️ Contact\n\n- **Discord:** [Support Server or](https://discord.gg/94c45XagEH) @CG360\n- **GitHub:** [/squeeglii](https://github.com/squeeglii)\n\n\n## 📜 Credits:\n\nSee [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](/ATTRIBUTIONS.md) for credits with attached licenses, such as for sounds and code.\nThere are some smaller credits also found on [the original Forge repository!](https://github.com/yyon/grapplemod/)\nwhich have been omitted here.\n\n### Technical Contributions\n\n- **Original Mod** - Yyon\n- **Textures** - Mayesnake\n- **Forge 1.18+** - Nyfaria\n- **Fabric/Quilt 1.18.2+** - CG360\n\n### Translations\n\n- **Russian** - Blueberryy\n- **French** - Neerwan\n- **Brazilian Portuguese** - Eufranio\n\n\n\n\n--- \n\n# Contributing\n\nPull Requests and Issues are always welcome! Try to stick to templates where available but deviate if some components\ndon't apply. Detail is important when debugging an issue or trying to implement a new system however so prioritise\nthat!\n\nThanks for any help in advance! :)  -- I keep an eye out for Issues and PRs fairly regularly.\n",

Fast, one seat, medium difficulty.\n\n![Biplane](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/1cd4e2e5afa0bb45bc3622c7abfce47f14293794.jpeg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Airship\n\nSlower, but with two seats. Quite easy to maneuver, with acceptable speed thanks to the engine in the back.\n\n![Airship](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/d1e925cdcb7d4212c3ec688af6ab9017f8a2fde3.jpeg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Gyrodyne\n\nHuman-powered primitive dual seater. Trusty, yet neither the fastest nor the easiest to fly.\nNeeds a good initial push to get the rotor spinning.\nThe first one guessing my inspiration here can suggest one new (fitting) aircraft :)\n\n![Gyrodyne](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/f21c7ed0070043cfd12cb66afaa2cf8e04dbdab0.jpeg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Some items to tinker\n\nSince aircraft are generally more complex than, e.g. a boat, a handful of items has been added to make crafting aircraft feel more like actually assembling something.\n\n![Recipes](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/b483b7f43b2afab67e59f7c3e3f09dcfefd89b60.png)",

          "body": "## Overview\nData Driven Block and Item Revelation system. Discover as you go!\n\nRevelationary adds a way to gate the discovery of new blocks in the world via data pack, or API (for other mods).\nUsing Revelationary, you can design your packs / mods progression in a way the player does not feel overwhelmed when starting a new playthrough. They can only perceive these worldgen blocks when they unlocked a specific advancement, making the block visible for them.\n\nExample:\nThe player sees a specific ore as stone. As they defeat the enderdragon they can now see and mine your ore in the world - it was always there from the start. Individual for each player and very performant.\n\n## Revelations\n\"[a] revelation is the revealing or disclosing of some form of truth or knowledge\"\n\nIf you are the designer of a progression based mod or modpack you have come to the right place.\n\nWith Revelationary, you are able to use Data Packs or the Revelation API to gradually reveal blocks in the world as the player progresses. A plain stone filled cleft might be revealed as bursting with life and ore as the player defeats a boss or reaches an important milestone.\n\nAs long as a player does not have the necessary progress the blocks and items you register with Revelationary via API or Data Pack will just have cryptic names and in case of blocks in the world, will drop the same drops as the block it is disguised as, giving the player a seamless experience without getting flooded with unknown resources that they are not able to use at the start. Instead you can introduce resources just as they are needed.\n\n## Limitations\nBesides visuals and drops, disguised blocks retain all the properties of the original block: Hitbox, if light passes through and everything else. Keep that in mind when searching for fitting candidates. A perfect disguise for your Ore would be stone or deepslate, since these share a lot of similarities. Similarly you could disguise your elusive plant with a poppy: Both have a small hitbox and players can walk through them.\n\nIf you are a programmer you can use the Revelation API to dynamically change your blocks properties depending on if they are visible to the player, or not. This way you could even disguise your flower as air: Giving it an empty hitbox when disguised, your players might not even know it is there until they can see them!\n\n\nFind lots of examples for data packs & the API in Revelationary's wiki: https://github.com/DaFuqs/Revelationary/wiki\n\n## Registering Revelations via Data Pack\nHave to be placed in the folder `resources/data/<<mod_id>>/revelations`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"advancement\": \"spectrum:milestones/reveal_quitoxic_reeds\",\n  \"block_states\": {\n    \"minecraft:grass\": \"minecraft:beacon\",\n    \"minecraft:tall_grass\": \"minecraft:obsidian\",\n    \"minecraft:tall_grass[half=upper]\": \"minecraft:netherite_block\"\n  },\n  \"items\": {\n    \"minecraft:nether_star\": \"minecraft:gunpowder\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Registering a \"revelation aware\" block or item\n\n```java\npublic class CloakedItem extends Item implements RevelationAware {\n\t\n\tIdentifier cloakAdvancementIdentifier;\n\tItem cloakItem;\n\t\n\tpublic CloakedItem(Settings settings, Identifier cloakAdvancementIdentifier, Item cloakItem) {\n\t\tsuper(settings);\n\t\tthis.cloakAdvancementIdentifier = cloakAdvancementIdentifier;\n\t\tthis.cloakItem = cloakItem;\n\t\t\n\t\tregisterCloak();\n\t}\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic Identifier getCloakAdvancementIdentifier() {\n\t\treturn cloakAdvancementIdentifier;\n\t}\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic Hashtable<BlockState, BlockState> getBlockStateCloaks() {\n\t\treturn new Hashtable<>();\n\t}\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic Pair<Item, Item> getItemCloak() {\n\t\treturn new Pair<>(this, cloakItem);\n\t}\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onCloak() { }\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onUncloak() { }\n\t\n}\n```\n\n## Registering a Callback when Revelations happen\n\n```java\nRevelationHolder.registerRevelationCallback(new RevelationHolder.UncloakCallback() {\n    @Override\n    public void trigger(List<Identifier> advancements, List<Block> blocks, List<Item> items) {\n        for(Block block : blocks) {\n            if(Registry.BLOCK.getId(block).getNamespace().equals(MOD_ID)) {\n                ...\n                <I dunno. Like show a popup or something. You tell me>\n                ...\n                break\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\n# Discord\nYou will find a lot of helpful people on Spectrum's Discord.

Things you\nhave always noticed as being out of place, but have never been able to put your finger on because you have lacked the\nknowledge and tools to observe them. Now is the time!\n\nSpectrum is progression-based and tries not to give everything away at first glance.\nYour journey through its advancement trees will be cluttered by realizations, puzzles and lots of \"aaaaaah\"s.\nEach step of your journey will be hinted at through advancements and the in-game guidebook you receive as soon as you\nfind your first geode.\n\nThere is no hand-holding, so everything will require a fair bit of experimentation or exploration.\nThis also means that it may not be the best fit for everyone. Everyone plays Minecraft differently and that is perfectly\nfine!\n\n**_Spectrum is not meant to be rushed or grinded through. It is best played alongside your playthrough._**\n\n## Everything you ever wanted in a Magic Mod\n\n- handcrafted progression & revelation system\n- lots of new magical equipment, items, blocks, decorations\n- lots of new enchantments & potion effects\n- New fluids with full collision & unique effects\n- build your own, customizable crafting structures\n- lots of handcrafted new sounds and particles\n- new unique ores, plants and geodes\n- custom structures with intriguing puzzles\n\n![Item Showcase](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/93d47cbb91a93ca610013ef17893648e3865590b.png)\n\n## Revelations\n\nJust because something looks like stone doesn't mean it is...\n\n![Obscured Items](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/525879685786e1c53ac1d26f9ca9d88206e836ab.png)\n\nThere is a lot to uncover and lots of discoveries to be made.\n\n![Revelations](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/d18f44e516fd6d7fbe3d1c7217534bf709209629.png)\n\n## Is this mod for me?\n**You might enjoy Spectrum if you like the following:** Outer Wilds; Myst; Thaumcraft; Chromaticraft; figuring out how\nand why things work\n\n**You will probably hate Spectrum if you like the following:** Generic tech mod #7 with linear progression that tells\nyou exactly what to do at every step; following video tutorials 1:1\n\n# Progressing through the mod\n\nYou may notice that most items only show up with a locked recipe in your recipe viewer.\nIn Spectrum, recipes and their matching guidebook entries are unlocked step by step, giving you something new to toy\nwith, with each new discovery you made.\n\nEverything will be hinted at via advancements and the guidebook gifted to you when you stumble upon your first geode:\nyour own, personal notebook.\nEverything you stumble upon, every recipe you unlock, every discovery you make you will note there.\n\n![Guidebook](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/6490d0b59d852952022da1d0b73dad128829a50f.png)\n\n## New ways to craft\n\nSpectrum features lots of new ways to express yourself.\nIts multiblock structures are designed in a way to feel satisfying, fun to play with and to give you the opportunity to\nexpress your creativity by giving you lots of freedom on how to construct and personalize them.\n\n![Pedestal Crafting](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/557edb80e180b9b5a85aedd0fa2c673c310cbbf9.png)\n\n# Spectrum's Discord\nYou will find a lot of helpful people on Spectrum's Discord.\nThere are always friendly and helpful people around.\nFeel free to swing by if you like!\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/EXU9XFXT8a\n\n## Lots of room to tinker for modpack makers\n\nPretty much everything is configurable, from recipes to the whole progression path.\nSpectrum also comes with lots of new advancement criteria.\n\nThe full and extensive documentation for modpack makers is available\nin [Spectrum's Wiki](https://github.com/DaFuqs/Spectrum/wiki).\nPlayers will find everything they need in the extensive ingame guidebook.\n\n## Want to contribute?\n\nEvery single input and be it just feedback or a bug report is greatly appreciated!\n\n## Mod Integration\n- AE2: Lots of additional Recipes;

Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.\n\n**Botania's design philosophy**\n\n* No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;\n* No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n* No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;\n* Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n* Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\n**Botania's goals**\n\n* Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n* Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;\n* Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;\n* Create an overall immersive experience.\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Botania today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://botaniamod.net/index.html)**\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)- - ",

To resolve this issue, you'll need to perform a block update on affected hedges or grass topped walls. Here's how:\nPlace any block above/next to the affected wall or hedge, or break and replace the affected wall or hedge, which will trigger an update for neighboring hedges/walls.\n\n\nPerformance\n- Reduced states from around 11000 to around 4600\n- This causes lower memory usage by 40-50%\n\n\nChanges\n- Hedges, Grass topped walls will have an adjusted newer model\n- Hedges & Grass Topped Walls are no longer coded as Walls but as   Fences ( so instead of 324 states for one wall there is just 32 )\n- Modern walls placed on top of each other now don't leave an open space\n\n\nTranslations added:\nes_cl by Ganbare-Lucifer\nde_de by PatrickK01\nuk_ua by Moonvvell\nru_ru by cutiegin\n\n\nFixed Issues:\n- Grass Topped Walls have a transparent pixel\n- Carpet placed on Grass Topped Walls is z-fighting\n- Grass Topped Walls & Pillar Walls have invisible side when placed\n  next to transparent blocks\n- Cherry and Bamboo fences don't have axe as its mining tool\n",

          "name": "Bridges 3.0.0",
          "version_number": "3.0.0",
          "changelog": "Update Warning: Important Information\n\nWe're thrilled to introduce the latest 3.0.0 update, which includes significant optimizations.\n\nIf you are updating from an older version to this one and have already placed bridges or stairs, please note that they will look weird due to changes in the update. To resolve this issue, you'll need to perform a block update on affected bridges or stairs. Here's how:\n\nPlace any block above/next to the affected bridge or stairs, or break and replace the affected bridge or stairs, which will trigger an update for neighboring bridges.\n\nWe highly recommend creating backups of your existing game worlds before applying this update.\n\nChangelog:\n\nPerformance:\n- Made many changes, to reduce the memory usage as much as I could, lowered memory usage by 80-90%.\n- Refactored code to be more efficient and optimized\n- Lowered the count of all blockstates by 85 - 89 % \n  ( From 13920 to 1516 )\n- Removed lots of model.jsons and made them more efficient\n\nAdded :\n- Stone Bridges, Stairs, Piers have new variations \n  ( nether bricks, mossy cobblestone, cobblestone, end stone bricks,\n   prismarine bricks, andesite, granite, diorite )\n- New Balustrade Stone Bridges ( 17 variations )\n- Red Asian Bridge, Support, Stairs\n- Glass Bridge, Support, Stairs\n\nBridge Torch & Lantern:\n- Can be placed on bridge/bridge stairs railings ( They have a tooltip )\n- Cannot be placed in the middle\n- They break if there is no solid block below them\n\nBridge Piers:\n- Can now be waterlogged (again!..)\n- Have a new model\n\nChanges:\n- Most bridges have an improved model\n- All Bridges have now the same height (base/railings), this change fixes the no step sounds whilst walking on a bridge\n- Removed Torches in bridges, made separate torches which can be placed on bridge/bridge stair railing ( to prevent doubling the states because of this..)\n- Rope Bridges have only 2 facing sides, north and east. Since west and south would be the same as north and east, we decided to merge it so it wont create redundant blockstates\n- Bridge handrails/handguards have been reworked, you can now toggle between all 4 sides or empty platform, with this change you can modify bridges like never before\n- Bridges have an updated placing mechanism, if you place a bridge while on a bridge, it will place down a bridge in the way you are facing ( Similar to the scaffolding )\n- Bridge Stairs have also an updated placing mechanism, if you place the stair on the stair, it will build another stair one block behind and above it, this way you can easily build bridge stairs upwards.\n- Shears can be used like pliers\n- Bridges now have a tooltip about Pliers/Shears\n- Bridges and Stairs cannot be placed directly above themselves, this makes it easier to build\n- Bridge Piers/Supports no longer connect but they have an improved model to make them look just as good as before\n- All Stone recipes can now be crafted in the stonecutter too\n- Bridges now have the tag Trapdoors, this is because entities are pathfinding it when it has the tag...\n\nNew Translations:\nfr_fr by Calvineries\nko_kr by spinodal23\nuk_ua by Moonvvell\nes_cl by Ganbare-Lucifer\n\nUpdated Translations:\nru_ru by mindryder\nde_de by PatrickK01\nes_es by Divinium115\n\nIssues Fixed:\n- Bridges have no step sound\n- Wrong breaking sounds on a few blocks\n- Wrong hardness on some blocks\n- Bridge Piers/Supports cannot be waterlogged\n- Two Wide Bridges don't connect to stairs\n- Stone and Log Bridges have wrong texture for bottom\n- Wrong texture UV size on some stairs\n- Iron Bridge can be used as fuel\n- Bridge stairs alignment is weird\n- Z-fighting on some bridges and stairs\n- Pliers do not appear in creative menu or JEI\n- Pliers unable to make a bridge fully open\n- Bamboo and Dry Bamboo Bridges and Stairs do not fully\n  connect\n- Missing mcw tags from some blocks\n- Mobs Pathfinding get stuck on bridge ( They now walk correctly on the base bridge, but when there is a block with handrail they will jump-move, but they are now pathfinding bridges )\n- Bridge Support is not a full block\n",

          "body": "## What...what is \"Cave Dust\"?\nI'm glad you asked! It's just a mod that adds the white ash particle from the Basalt Deltas biome to the underground to simulate dust! After all, the air wouldn't be 100% clear in a real mineshaft :p\n\nNow to the nitty gritty: It works by checking if the player has the sky above them while being below sea level and then scales the amount of particles based on depth.\n\nIt has a config system that you can access using Mod Menu, most things you can change in-game, but to change the particle you'll need to open the config file manually :)\nAs a note, it doesn't activate in the Lush Caves biome, since it already has it's own particles :p\n\nThis was inspired by Dylanstime in the [moonflower Discord server](​https://www.moonflower.gg/discord), thanks for the idea!\n![Screenshot of Discord message from Dylanstime, reading: \"is it possible to copy the code for the dust in the basalt deltas and put them in caves but smaller amounts and slower\nor maybe a mod that adds effects similar to it in other biomes\"](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/443/991/image_2022-03-26_163011.png)\n \n\n# Dependencies\nCave Dust requires the Fabric API but everything else Cave Dust needs is included. HOWEVER, I recommend Mod Menu to be able to use the config screen :p\n\n# Showcase video\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VO_Ye_GxLo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

          "body": "# Falling Leaves\n\nThis Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.20+ adds a neat little particle effect to leaf blocks.  \nUsers can configure which types of leaf blocks will drop leaves and the frequency that these leaves are dropped at.  \n  \nRequires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y6zGq33.gif)\n\nThis mod was brought over from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric), where all previous versions can be found.\n\n## Troubleshooting aka \"Why are no leaves falling?\"\n\nSome trees do not drop leaves by default, these are: conifer trees (like spruce and pine), large leaved trees (like jungle trees and palms) and shrubs.\n\nYou can change this as you like by adjusting \"Conifer Leaf Spawn Rate\" in the Mod Menu settings and adjusting the spawn rates for specific trees under \"Leaf Block Settings\".\n\nA complete list of all conifer trees is found [here](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/blob/1.19/src/main/java/randommcsomethin/fallingleaves/config/ConfigDefaults.java#L9-L27) and a list of all trees with adjusted spawn rates is found [here](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/blob/1.19/src/main/java/randommcsomethin/fallingleaves/config/ConfigDefaults.java#L37-L62).\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Is this compatible with trees from other mods? What about Resource Packs?\n  - Falling Leaves _should_ be 100% compatible with any modded trees and any resource pack changing leaves!\n\n- Does this need to be installed on the server for multiplayer?\n  - Nope! This mod is 100% client-side.\n\n- Lol fabric suxxx gief forge plx.\n  - Cheaterpaul [ported this mod to Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge \"Forge port\"), note that this port is inofficial and might not always be up-to-date, it also does configuration differently.\n\n- Do you have any screenshots I could look at before I install this?\n  - Sure! Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric/screenshots) of this mod's Curseforge page.  \n    (Note that they are slightly out of date.)\n\n- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft 1.7?\n  - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.\n\n- I found a problem / have an idea! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?\n  - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/issues).  \n    It makes it far easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.\n\n- Can I include this mod in my modpack?\n  - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our CurseForge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.\n\n- What do you get if you jumble the letters in \"Falling Leaves Mod\"?\n  - You get \"Five Golden Llamas\". We're still not sure if this means anything in particular...",

Or maybe a nether fortress made out of pure magna? Perhaps you are just here to build a house out of dirt or a totem pole with the infamous dioritefaces? Either way we got you covered!\n\nChipped is a 1.16+ building mod that expands on the variety of blocks you can use in-game. The mod offers over 11,000 unique building blocks, from stained glass variations all the way to conerete, prismarine and even gilded blackstone! Not only are all\nthe textures hand-made in the vanilla style, but they also include many connected textures, powered by [Athena](https://modrinth.com/mod/athena-ctm)! \n\nInspired by the popular Chisel mod, Chipped allous builders to have their full range of\ncreativity because every bock deserves a friend!\n\nTo start out all you have to do is craft one of the seven tables that allow you to change various vanilla blocks into their chipped variants. All tables look different, but work the same, so you can pick whichever looks best in your build, or make a few different ones and spread them out in your home. Whatever you want to do, Chipped can help you bring it to life!\n\n---\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r9FApKUUDnE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/etTMvDsZE1w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VREpW7fLmXo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n---\n\n<center>\n\n### Developers:\nAlex Nijjar, Grim, MsRandom1, CodexAdrian, ThatGravyBoat\n### Artists:\nKekie6, Marc-IceBlade, Shrimp, Facu, Frogipher, SunsetSoup, Valilla, Brother Earth, Joosh, ArtistMonster, Zilver\n\n---\n\n### Socials\n\n[![youtube-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/youtube-plural_vector.svg)](https://youtube.terrarium.earth)\n[![twitch-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/twitch-plural_vector.svg)](https://www.twitch.tv/terrariumearth)\n[![twitter-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/twitter-plural_vector.svg)](https://twitter.terrarium.earth)\n[![kofi-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/donate/kofi-plural_vector.svg)](https://kofi.terrarium.earth)\n[![discord-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/discord-plural_vector.svg)](https://discord.terrarium.earth)\n[![modrinth](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/available/modrinth_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/organization/terrarium)\n[![curseforge](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/available/curseforge_vector.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/members/terrariumearth/projects)\n---\n\n### Check out our other projects\n\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/handcrafted\"><img src=\"https://images.teamresourceful.com/u/9DjUsr.svg\" alt=\"Handcrafted\" width=\"96\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/chipped\"><img src=\"https://images.teamresourceful.com/u/lRunun.svg\" alt=\"Chipped\" width=\"96\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra\"><img src=\"https://images.teamresourceful.com/u/snZW6z.svg\" alt=\"Ad Astra\" width=\"96\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/tempad\"><img src=\"https://images.teamresourceful.com/u/HPp8Fo.svg\" alt=\"Tempad\" width=\"96\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/spirit\"><img src=\"https://images.teamresourceful.com/u/SQ4Me7.svg\" alt=\"Colorful Azalaeas\" width=\"96\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/argonauts\"><img src=\"https://images.teamresourceful.com/u/05PfzF.svg\" alt=\"Lil Wings\" width=\"96\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/cadmus\"><img src=\"https://images.teamresourceful.com/u/YqZ7Hf.svg\" alt=\"Vitalize\" width=\"96\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/heracles\"><img src=\"https://images.teamresourceful.com/u/RzlEoy.svg\" alt=\"Spirit\" width=\"96\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/prometheus\"><img src=\"https://images.teamresourceful.com/u/DP8PUz.svg\" alt=\"Reaper\" width=\"96\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/common-storage-lib\"><img src=\"http://images.teamresourceful.com/u/wP2ReQ.svg\" alt=\"Experience Obelisk\" width=\"96\"></a>\n</center>",

          "body": "# Copper Hopper\n\nCopper Hopper adds a new kind of Hopper that filters the items to get pulled and pushed.  They\nsave you the tedium of building gigantic item sorters while retaining a Vanilla Minecraft spirit.\n\n**UPDATE 09/14/2023 - By popular demand, Copper Hopper now includes Copper Hopper Minecarts!**\n\n### Features\n* Filter up to 5 items per Copper Hopper\n* Filter both stackable and unstackable items\n* Uses the Fabric modloader\n* Make Copper Hopper Minecarts!\n* Made of copper!\n\n## Recipes\n\n![Recipe](https://github.com/pcal43/copper-hopper/blob/main/etc/copper-hopper-crafting.png?raw=true)\n\n![Recipe](https://github.com/pcal43/copper-hopper/blob/main/etc/copper-hopper-minecart-recipe.png?raw=true)\n\n## Setting Filters\n\n![Filters](https://github.com/pcal43/copper-hopper/blob/main/etc/dialog.png?raw=true)\n\n## Make sorting systems like this!\n\n![System](https://github.com/pcal43/copper-hopper/blob/main/etc/sorted_storage.png?raw=true)\n\n![Minecart](https://github.com/pcal43/copper-hopper/blob/main/etc/copper-hopper-minecart-screenshot.png?raw=true)\n\n\n## How do use it?\n\nJust put an item in one of the regular hopper slots to \"set\" a filter.  That item will never be pulled or\npushed out of the hopper.  And the hopper will now only accept items of that type.\n\nYou can do this up to five times (once per slot).\n\n## How does it work exactly?\n\nA Copper Hopper works just like a regular hopper except:\n\n* They never accept an item of a type that is not already held in the hopper.\n* They always keep the last item of a type that is held in the hopper.\n* If one Copper Hopper is below another, it will always pull matching items before the upper hopper pushes them.\n  * This allows you to create hopper columns that filter items into vertically-stacked chests.\n\n## Does it work with unstackable items?\n\nYes!  But if you filter on unstackable items, be sure to keep one of the hopper slots empty or\nthe filtering won't work correctly.\n\n## Notes\n\n* The item texture for Copper Hopper was contributed by [Pablo Henrique](https://github.com/ppblitto). (Thanks!)\n* Copper Hopper was inspired by Mr. Crayfish's excellent [Golden Hopper](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/golden-hopper) forge mod.\n* I will not be doing a Forge port of Copper Hopper. (sorry)\n \n\n## Legal\n\nThis mod is published under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\nYou're free to include this mod in your modpack provided you attribute it to pcal.net.\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf you have questions about this mod, please join the Discord server:\n\n[https://discord.pcal.net](https://discord.pcal.net)\n\n",

          "body": "REQUIRES FABRIC API\n\nCopper pipes can quickly and easily transport items from one place to another! Simply build a pipeline and you're good to go.\n\nThe part of the pipe with the protruding opening is the direction items will flow in. If there is no block in front of the pipe the items will shoot out, so be careful!\n\nPipes can also insert items into any block with an inventory like chests, hoppers, and barrels, and themselves.\nCopper Pipes are crafted just how you think they'd be- three copper in a row, an empty row, and three more copper.\n\nMoving And Dispensing Items:\n\nIf a Copper Pipe is pointing into air or water, it will automatically shoot out its items. To prevent this, placing something as simple as a Torch in front of it will suffice.\n\nCopper Pipes will deposit their items into inventories like Chests, Barrels, and the Copper Fitting. They can also take out these items from those blocks, making them easy to use for intersections and storage.\n\nCopper Pipes with Dispensers behind them will shoot items farther depending on their oxidization state and color, and Copper Pipes with Droppers behind them will shoot items out at a medium range, regardless of oxidization and color.\n\nCopper Pipes that are being powered by Redstone will \"shoot\" specific items like Arrows, Splash Potions, and Snowballs, making them more versatile.\n\nWaxed pipes are the fastest, while normal pipes are slightly slower.\n\nCopper Fittings will prevent the flow of items whilst being powered.\n\nSmoke And Water Leaking:\n\nCopper Pipes are able to leak water and smoke under specific circumstances.\n\nIf a Pipe is Waterlogged or Water is placed directly behind the Pipe, the water will move along the Pipeline. This is visualized with drops of water falling from pipes.\n\nWater will flow through up to 12 pipes, where it will then stop. By placing Copper Fittings in the Pipeline, you can renew the flow of water as much as you'd like.\n\nFarmland can stay damp if under a leaking pipe that's up to 12 blocks above it and Sugar Cane are able to \ngrow under these same circumstances, removing the need for you to place them next to water sources.\n\nAll mobs will be considered to be in water if under a pipe that's up to 12 blocks above them, meaning that all mobs will be extinguished if under a pipe, and Endermen will be damaged by walking under a Leaking Pipe.\n\nSmoke follows these same rules, needing a Lit Campfire to be placed behind the entry pipe. Copper Fittings will renew the flow of smoke.\n\nBee Hives and Bee Nests will count Smoking Pipes as Campfires, allowing Copper Pipes to be used in honey farming.\n\nOxidization, Waxing, & Lightning:\n\nAll Copper Pipes and Copper Fittings will oxidize over time. To prevent this, you can alt-click on one with a Honeycomb, or combine and Honeycomb and a Pipe/Fitting in a Crafting Table. Waxed Pipes will transport items faster, making them a more preferable choice.\n\nAlt-clicking on a Pipe or Fitting will remove its wax, and if it's unwaxed, will revert its oxidization stage by one.\n\nCopper Pipes and Copper Fittings can de-oxidize from lightning, but you'll have to set them up properly for it to work.\n\nWhen a Lightning Rod is triggered on top of (or directly next to) a pipe or fitting, electricity will surge through the entire pipeline.\n\nEach time a pipe or fitting receives electricity they'll de-oxidize by one stage, and glowing pipes/fittings will glow.\nIf a Pipe or Fitting is completely oxidized, you can put it in a furnace to Corrode it.\n\nVibrations:\n\nWhen a Copper Pipe's opening is exposed to air, it will pick up Vibrations and send them through the pipeline, which can be used to distract Wardens or work with Sculk's mechanics easier.\n\nAll Copper Pipes with an exposed opening will pick up Vibrations, though the Vibration particle will only appear if a Block or Entity that can listen to it is around; this can be controlled via tags, but keep in mind that this is purely visual- the Vibrations will still be emitted.\n\nNote Blocks will also be picked up by pipes, which will also be sent through pipelines like vibrations.\n\nCopper Fittings are not required to renew Vibrations as they can travel through entire pipelines on their own as of 1.10.\n\nOther:\n\nAlternate-Clicking on a pipe with a hoe will rotate it.\nPipes will bubble underwater.\n\n(Maybe they're not so simple after all..?)",

Real Magic! ⛄\n\nThis simple tweak mod can enrich the vanilla snow layer's behavior.\n\nWith this mod you can:\n\n - Place snow and fence/wall/tallgrass in the same block!\n - The snow layer will fall like sand. If it touches the water source, it will become ice!\n - The snow layer will accumulate during a snowstorm!\n - The snow layer will have a thinner bounding box like in the Bedrock edition!\n - Reduce fall damage on snow!\n - Make snow always replaceable by other blocks!\n - Crouch + right-click snow to make a snowball\n - Make snow never melt (disabled by default)\n - Make snow fall on ice (disabled by default)\n - And more!\n \nAll features can be disabled in the config.\n\nTo work with Sodium, you need to install Indium.\n\n[![Interested in supporting me and the development of mods?

          "body": "Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ",

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

However to view them directly in-game, insert a written Book named \"credits\" in a Notice Board.\nAlso some sounds are from Zapsplat so credit to them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

On the right side of the screen, it shows more details about the mod, such as authors, a description, links, credits, and a button to configure the mod.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/images/155dd2b006883b168b1279ec0ff21e753946518b.png)\n\nMod Menu lets you view the mods you have installed and, if supported by the mod, enables quick and easy access to the mod's config screens.\n\nMod Menu also supports some more advanced features, such as translatable mod names and descriptions, support for [QuickText formatting](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/quicktext/) in mod descriptions thanks to [Patbox](https://ko-fi.com/patbox)'s [Text Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api), filters library mods out from regular mods, a mod update checker for mods hosted on Modrinth or that provide their own update sources, and deep configuration for all the features we provide.\n\n### Supported Platforms\nMod Menu is currently available for Fabric or Quilt on Minecraft: Java Edition 1.14 or newer.\n\n## Developers\nMod Menu includes a number of APIs for developers to improve how their mod appears in Mod Menu. These come in the form of language keys, JSON metadata, and even a Java API.\n\n### Translation API\nYou can translate your mod's name, summary, and description all without touching any Java code. Simply add translation keys in the supported format to any language you'd like.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Translation API Documentation</summary>\n\nHere's an example of Mod Menu's translations into Pirate Speak. To create your own, simply replace `modmenu` at the end (***NOT*** the one in the beginning) of the translation key with your own mod ID, for example `modmenu.descriptionTranslation.traverse`.\n\n`en_pt.json`\n```json\n\"modmenu.nameTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods!\",\n\"modmenu.descriptionTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\",\n\"modmenu.summaryTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\"\n```\n\n> The summary translation is redundant here and does not need to be included because it's the same as the description, but it was included to show that you may translate the summary (a short, one-sentence description of the mod) separately from the description, even in English!\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Fabric Metadata API\nThere's a number of things you can add just with metadata in your `fabric.mod.json`.\n\nAll of these are added to a custom block in your `fabric.mod.json` for Mod Menu's metadata. Here's an example usage of many of the features this API provides:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n      },\n      \"badges\": [ \"library\", \"deprecated\" ],\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"id\": \"example-api\",\n        \"name\": \"Example API\",\n        \"description\": \"Modular example library\",\n        \"icon\": \"assets/example-api-module-v1/parent_icon.png\",\n        \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n      },\n      \"update_checker\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fabric Metadata API Documentation</summary>\n\n#### Badges (`\"badges\": [ ]`)\nWhile the `Client` badge is added automatically to mods set as client-side only (set `\"environment\": \"client\"` in `fabric.mod.json` to do this.), other badges such as the `Library` and `Deprecated` badges require definition here.\n\nSupported values:\n- `library` - should be assigned to mods that are purely dependencies for other mods that should not be shown to the user by default unless they toggle them on.\n- `deprecated` - should be assigned to mods that exist purely for legacy reasons, such as an old API module or such.\n\nAny others will be ignored, and Mod Menu does not support adding your own badges. You may open an issue [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/issues) if you have a compelling use case for a new badge.\n\n#### Links (`\"links\": { }`)\nThe `links` object allows mod authors to add custom hyperlinks to the end of their description. If you specify a `sources` contact in the official `fabric.mod.json` metadata, it will also be included in the links section.\n\nAny key in the `links` object will be included in the links section, with the key being used as a translation key. For example, this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nwill show as a link with the text \"Discord\", since \"Discord\" is the English translation of \"modmenu.discord\" provided by Mod Menu.\n\nMod Menu provides several default translations that can be used for links. A full list can be seen in Mod Menu's language file [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/blob/-/src/main/resources/assets/modmenu/lang/en_us.json). All default link translation keys take the form `modmenu.<type>`.\n\nYou can also provide your own translations if you would like to add custom links. Make sure to use ***your own namespace*** (as opposed to `modmenu`) for any custom keys.\n\n#### Parents (`\"parent\": \"mod_id\" or { }`)\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZutCprf.png\">\n\nParents are used to display a mod as a child of another one. This is meant to be used for mods divided into different modules. The following element in a `fabric.mod.json` will define the mod as a child of the mod 'flamingo': \n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": \"flamingo\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to group mods under a parent, but the parent isn't an actual mod, you can do that too. In the example below, a mod is defining metadata for a parent. Make sure that this metadata is included in all of the children that use the fake/dummy parent. This can also be used as a fallback for an optional parent, it will be replace by the mod's real metadata if present.\n\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": {\n            \"id\": \"this-mod-isnt-real\",\n            \"name\": \"Fake Mod\",\n            \"description\": \"Do cool stuff with this fake mod\",\n            \"icon\": \"assets/real-mod/fake-mod-icon.png\",\n            \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDummy parent mods only support the following metadata:\n- `id` (String)\n- `name` (String)\n- `description` (String)\n- `icon` (String)\n- `badges` (Array of Strings)\n\n\n#### Disable update checker (`\"update_checker\": false`)\nBy default, Mod Menu's update checker will use the hash of your mod's jar to lookup the latest version on Modrinth. If it finds a matching project, it will check for the latest version that supports your mod loader and Minecraft version, and if it has a different hash from your existing file, it will prompt the user that there is an update available.\n\nYou can disable the update checker by setting `update_checker` to false in your Mod Menu metadata like so:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"update_checker\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Quilt Metadata API\nSince Mod Menu supports Quilt as well, the same APIs in the Fabric Metadata API section are also available for Quilt mods, but the format for custom metadata is slightly different. \n\nInstead of a `\"modmenu\"` block inside of a `\"custom\"` block, you put the `\"modmenu\"` block as an element in the root object. So it should look like:\n\n`quilt.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"modmenu\": {\n    // Here's where your links, badges, etc. stuff goes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Java API\nTo use the Java API, you'll need to add Mod Menu as a compile-time dependency in your gradle project. This won't make your mod require Mod Menu, but it'll be present in your environment for you to test with.\n\n`build.gradle`\n```gradle\n// Add the Terraformers maven repo to your repositories block\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    name = \"Terraformers\"\n    url = \"https://maven.terraformersmc.com/\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Mod Menu as a dependency in your environment\ndependencies {\n  modImplementation(\"com.terraformersmc:modmenu:${project.modmenu_version}\")\n}\n```\nThen, define the version of Mod Menu you're using in your `gradle.properties`. You can get the latest version number [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/latest), but you may need a different version if you're not using the latest Minecraft version. See the [versions page](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions) for a full list of versions.\n\n`gradle.properties`\n```properties\nmodmenu_version=VERSION_NUMBER_HERE\n```\n> If you don't want it in your environment for testing but still want to compile against Mod Menu for using the Java API, you can use `modCompileOnly` instead of `modImplementation` (this will work even if Mod Menu is not updated to the version of Minecraft you're running).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Java API Documentation</summary>\n\n### Getting Started\nTo use the API, implement the ModMenuApi interface on a class and add that as an entry point of type \"modmenu\" in your `fabric.mod.json` like this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"modmenu\": [ \"com.example.mod.ExampleModMenuApiImpl\" ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mod Config Screens\nMods can provide a Screen factory to provide a custom config screen to open with the config button. Implement the `getModConfigScreenFactory` method in your API implementation to do this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for mods to provide their own config screens. The mod id of the config screen is automagically determined by the source mod container that the entrypoint originated from.\n\n### Provided Config Screens\nMods can provide Screen factories to provide a custom config screens to open with the config buttons for other mods as well. Implement the `getProvidedConfigScreenFactories` method in your API implementation for this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for a mod like Cloth Config to provide config screens for mods that use its API.\n\n### Modpack Badges\nMods can give other mods the `Modpack` badge by implementing the `attachModpackBadges` method, such as through the following:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void attachModpackBadges(Consumer<String> consumer) {\n\tconsumer.accept(\"modmenu\"); // Indicates that 'modmenu' is part of the modpack\n}\n```\n\nNote that 'internal' mods such as Minecraft itself and the mod loader cannot be given the modpack badge, as they are not distributed within a typical modpack.\n\n### Static Helper Methods\n`ModMenuApi` also offers a few helper methods for mods that want to work with Mod Menu better, like making their own Mods buttons.\n\n#### Creating a Mods screen instance\nYou can call this method to get an instance of the Mods screen:\n```java\nScreen createModsScreen(Screen previous)\n```\n\n#### Creating a Mods button `Text`\nYou can call this method to get the Text that would be displayed on a Mod Menu Mods button:\n```java\nText createModsButtonText()\n```\n\n</details>",

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

          "body": "This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.",

          "body": "## BadOptimizations\nA collection of mostly micro optimizations that add up to something bigger!\n\n## Wait, what does this even do?\nIt does multiple things:<p>\n\n- **Avoid updating lightmap**<p>\n  Updating lightmap textures are probably the most expensive part of the client tick. During each tick, the client will do some vector math to calculate lightmaps for blocks and the sky, then upload that new texture to the GPU. However, this can be completely avoided and cached if nothing affecting brightness is changed. This mod will cancel lightmap updates if nothing that changes brightness (e.g. gamma slider, potion effects) has changed. \n- **Sky color calculation optimizations**<p>\n  Minecraft uses `CubicScampler.sampleColor` every frame to calculate the current sky color. This function loops 216 times to factor in surrounding biomes-even if all surrounding biomes are identical or have identical sky colors. This mod makes this function only get called if you are between biomes with different sky colors and only makes it get called every tick. Otherwise, a shorter, simpler and faster sky color calculation is used.\n- **Don't do debug logic if we don't need to**<p>\n  Minecraft has four debug renderers that can be activated with a debug server: bees, game events, game test and villager AI. Even if there's nothing to process, the logic for these debug renderers are still executed. This mod will only execute them if debug is enabled and there is data to process.\n\n<p>\nThat's all the major ones, at least.\nYou can disable any optimization in the config file if you need to.\n</p>\n\n## But how much does it help?\n*(tested on my own PC with an RTX 3060, intel i7 12700 and 4GB of allocated ram on Fabulously Optimized)*<p>\nWithout toasts, it goes from 1926-1955 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/523f9117-5dfb-469a-a1e3-2e5c32597057\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 2008-2023 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/a27fcfab-c9ac-4fb0-9dfa-fc2efc61b2f4\" width=\"256\"><p>\nAnd with toasts, it goes from 1351-1384 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/859f710b-036e-4080-9e94-ceaaf5a9bbf9\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 1414-1458 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/5a01d4a7-0789-465d-a08f-aaa54386deb7\" width=\"256\"><p>\n\n## Dependencies?\nNone.\n\n*(Also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/badoptimizations)!)*",

          "body": "<p style=\"text-align:center\">Attribute Fixer</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Minecraft uses an attribute system to handle important calculations. It covers everything from armor values, to attack damage, to the maximum health of a mob. This system also introduced attribute caps, which limit how high any value can be. While this usually goes unnoticed, many mods are unknowingly affected by it. This mod significantly increases these caps to allow those mods to work as they were intended.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Affected Attributes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Max Health</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Follow Range</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Knockback Resistance</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Movement Speed</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Attack Damage</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Attack Speed</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Armor&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Armor Toughness</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Luck</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

          "body": "Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n",

It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20. Starlight and Vanilla are close enough on 1.20 that\nthis test is also useless.\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZQx7Ek0.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/MrA2PQk.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")\n\nPerformance for 1.19.4 and below:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png \"Light engine time chunk generation Graph\")\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")",

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com//partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.",

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n",

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n- Most closed source \"clients\" like LunarClient and LabyMod\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n- [**isXander**](https://github.com/isXander) - Founder of project\n- [**Contributors**](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/graphs/contributors) - For PRing new fixes!\n- [**MoonTidez**](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Creating an awesome logo!\n\n### Translators\n- [**RaptaG**](https://github.com/RaptaG) - Greek\n- [**Altegar**](https://github.com/Altegar) - Ukrainian\n- [**ttrafford7**](https://github.com/ttrafford7) - Ukrainian\n- [**GodGun968**](https://github.com/GodGun968) - Chinese\n- [**Agentew04**](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Portuguese\n- [**localfossa**](https://github.com/localfossa) - Turkish\n- [**xMikux**](https://github.com/xMikux) - Traditional Chinese\n",

          "body": "# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nYou can also configure these settings for when you're idling (with a custom timeout) or while your laptop / handheld is on battery.  \nOptionally you may also display the current battery status on the in-game HUD and receive toast notifications about battery activity.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops\nrendering the world while it's being obscured by resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nEnabling the battery integration requires downloading an additional library at runtime.  \nThe mod contains the hashes for these files ahead of time and will verify them before usage.\n\nYou may disable this behavior in the mod's settings, or [install the library yourself](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/blob/main/docs/manual-natives-install.md) if you wish.\n",

          "body": "LazyDFU is an optimization mod for Minecraft that defers unnecessary initialization work so that it is only performed if required. Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)",

          "body": "## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n\n### [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) is required to use EBE with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium). <br/><br/> \n**Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)**\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests have glitched animations!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using Sodium, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use Sodium with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You may be using a resource pack that conflicts with EBE. Open the Block Entity Settings menu (through EBE's Mod Menu entry or through vanilla Video Settings) and enable \"Force Resource Pack Compatibility\". <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n- Decorated Pots\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)",

          "body": "Model Gap FIX\n\n \n\nThis is a simple client mod that fixes https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73186\n\nwhich affects both Block Models and Item Models and possibly other models too\n\n \n\nThe mod works by removing texture zooming, making every model face use 100% of its texture, unlike of what it did previoulsly.\n\nThisnot only fixes this bugs on items (where it's most noticeable) but with block models too and everything else that might use those functions.\n\n \n\nThis issue was especially noticeable with custom block models or some 2d items.\n\n \n\n \n\nQ&A:\n\n- Will this slow down my game? \n\nNot at all! Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ",

          "body": "Alternate Current is an efficient and non-locational redstone dust implementation. Its main focus lies in reducing the lag caused by redstone dust, by optimizing the power calculations and reducing the number of shape and block updates emitted. As a side effect of these changes the block update order of redstone dust networks is predictable and intuitive rather than locational and chaotic.\n\n### Performance\n\nMSPT contributions of redstone dust are up to 20 times lower with Alternate Current, all the while maintaining a high level of Vanilla parity. Its low number of code modifications make it minimally invasive, so it's an easy drop-in replacement for Vanilla redstone dust.\n\nCheck out the [GitHub page](https://github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/alternate-current/blob/main/README.md) for a detailed explanation of Alternate Current's improvements.\n\n## Why is redstone dust so laggy?\n\nThere are two main reasons why redstone dust is laggy: unnecessary updates and unnecessary calculations, both of which are caused by the fact that redstone dust updates recursively. A redstone wire can update its power level over half a dozen times before settling on the final value, doing expensive calculations and emitting copious amounts of shape and block updates each time. On top of that, many shape and block updates are completely redundant. \n\n## How does Alternate Current fix that?\n\nAlternate Current fixes these issues by doing power calculations of the entire network before updating the power levels. Each wire will check power from non-wire components just once and power from other wires just twice. Power sources within the network are identified, and the power is spread from there. This makes the calculations more efficient and the update order more intuitive. Shape and block updates are only emitted when the final power level is reached, and each wire emits no redundant updates.",

That means the on/off state will no longer reset after reloading the world, and changing the on/off state in one world will no longer affect other worlds.\n\nThe config is stored at `<world root>/alternate-current.conf`, and the on/off state is saved in the `enabled` entry. Setting its value to `TRUE` will turn Alternate Current on for that world, whereas `FALSE` will turn it off. \n\nYou can of course still change the on/off state with the `/alternatecurrent` command as well, and doing so will update that world's config.",

The difference is\nthat sleeping bags can be stacked and are more convenient to use on adventures and hammocks are like\nan inverse bed, turning day to night.\n\n## Features\n\n### Sleeping Bag\nThe recipe for the sleeping bag is simply three pieces of matching color wool in a straight line.\n\n**1.21 and above**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7WZn6Dn/sleeping-bag-recipes.gif)\n\n**1.20.6 and below**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/LCNV0HS/sleepingbagrecipe.gif)\n\nYou can also dye any sleeping bag into any of the other colors!\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/R24frvM/sleepingbagrecipe2.gif)\n\n### Hammock\nThe recipe for the hammock cloth is simply a piece of colored wool in the center, sticks to the top\nand bottom, and the rest of the slots are strings.\n\n**1.21 and above**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/vLFnSVN/hammock-recipes.gif)\n\n**1.20.6 and below**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nQZH5Ld/hammockrecipe.gif)\n\nYou can also dye any hammock cloth into any of the other colors!\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Jd5JcWf/hammockrecipe2.gif)\n\n**Please refer to [this](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Comforts/wiki/Hammocks#building) guide for\ninstructions on how to build the hammock.**\n\n**Configuration Options**\n\n- Auto-Use Sleeping Bag\n- Well-Rested Mechanic\n- Sleepiness Factor\n- Hammocks at Night\n- Sleeping Bag Break Chance\n- Sleeping Bag Debuffs\n- Insulated Sleeping Bags\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/5Tw6mh2/bisect-illusive.webp)](https://illusivesoulworks.com/affiliate)",

When you stop flying or leave your vehicle, your camera view will be restored to whatever it was before you started. Much of the mod is configurable through an extensive config file.\n\nThere's a few other camera-related goodies - an option to disable the \"first-person flipped\" camera, an option for fixing the \"weirdly rotated first-person hand\" in 1.7.10-and-earlier versions that happens when you look at yourself in f5, and a backport for pressing Shift to exit vehicles for 1.4.7.\n\n---\n\nNew things in version 2️⃣ of the mod:\n\n* All 13 versions use the same codebase.\n* New toggle key for temporarily disabling the mod. It is in the options screen under \"Miscellaneous\" and is unbound by default.\n* Forge versions use a regular Forge config file, instead of the custom thingie the mod used to use.\n\n---\n\nQuestions?

They create new Maps in new Dimensions as you'd expect.\n- The mini-map supports the ability to display your current X, Y, & Z coordinates as well as your current Biome\n- **Optional Trinkets support**: \n   - When Trinkets is installed, there will be a new Slot for an Atlas\n   - The Atlas will continue to function as normal inside the Trinkets slot\n\n![navigating_toast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17690401/206922018-2b6195e3-fbe8-4850-bf31-4896764a5747.png)\n\n- The Atlas has a world map view as well. To access this, right-click the Atlas or press \"m\" while the Atlas is on your hot-bar.\n- The world map has selectable tabs for each Dimension you've explored and created Map entries for.\n- It also has selectable tabs for each Banner you've added in each Dimension. Clicking these will snap the center of your view to the map containing the Banner.\n- The world map will display the active X & Z coordinates of the point your mouse is hovering over.\n- The Atlas world view has zoom support & scales by odd numbers 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, etc using your mouse scroll wheel.\n- The Atlas world view has full pan support as well, using your mouse to drag the world map.\n- Atlases also support right-clicking Banners to add \"waypoints\", which display in both the mini-map & world-view map.\n\n![sharing_toast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17690401/206922262-7346a3d7-8c76-4399-9d54-6cfb0f806c6e.png)\n\n- Atlases can be **merged** with a Cartography Table - simply put an Atlas in the top & bottom slots and the Atlases will combine their mapped regions with one-another!\n- **Atlases support Lecterns** - Show off your world by putting an Atlas in a Lectern! \n   - Simply right click a Lectern while holding an Atlas to display the Lectern\n   - The Atlas will appear visually different depending on the Dimension its displayed in - there's a unique texture for the Overworld, Nether, End and \"Other\".\n- Atlases can be stored in Chiseled Bookshelves in 1.20+ \n\n## ⚙️ Config\nThe mod is highly configurable and offers in-game config editing with ModMenu.

Clicking the patrol button will allow you to set patrol points for guards, melee guards will walk around the point while ranged guards will snipe enemies and stand still on their point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">You will only be able to gain access to their inventory if you have hero of the village.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/TY67xMt.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1114\" height=\"626\" /><br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">AI Changes</span></h3>\n<div class=\"spoiler\" style=\"display: block;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Witches attack villagers.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8px;\"> *true</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 8px;\"> by default&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xlObybm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"806\" height=\"453\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In raids, illagers kill any animal they see.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8px;\"> *f</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 8px;\">alse by default&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tpdbFcD.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"806\" height=\"332\" /></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Villagers and Illagers are scared of polar bears.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8px;\"> *true</span><span style=\"font-size: 8px;\"> by default&nbsp;</span> <br /></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/YTNZHp9/2020-03-22-18-54-41.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"957\" height=\"538\" /><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Clerics heal low-health guards, villagers, and players with Hero of the Village using regeneration potions, and smiths repair iron golems with ingots.<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x7U2CET.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1114\" height=\"626\" /></span></p>\n</div>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This can be an area, region, zone, town, kingdom etc. This is done with a placed sign. On it you specify the radius, optionally the rgb value and the name. This means that the radius around the sign is now considered an area. Whenever a player enters this area, they receive a message at the top of the GUI with (by default) \"Enter the area.\". And when they leave \"Leaving the area.\". This can both be changed in the config.<br><br>Names are randomly selected when the sign does not contain one. There is a global RGB value for the messages specified in the config, but this can also be a unique value again specified on the sign.

This name is given via a sign in the center of the village, see the description of Areas for more information on how this is done. It'll give your world a bit more immersion. It is possible to remove the sign and rename it, or remove the name altogether by placing an empty sign in its position.<br><br>The Areas mod has specific config options if you'd for example like to remove the \"Entering\" part of the displayed text.<br><br>You can also remove the automatically generated sign and place your own. Just make sure it's within a 15 block radius of the automated one.<br></span><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Commands:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><em>/areas</em> - Shows all area signs, which contains the village name, around the player.</span></p>\r\n<details><summary>Show Spoiler</summary>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/random-village-names/a.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"555\"></p>\r\n</details>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Example GIFs:</strong></span></p>\r\n<details><summary>Show Spoiler</summary>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/random-village-names/b.gif\" width=\"1000\" height=\"578\"></p>\r\n</details>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<details><summary>Show Spoiler</summary>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/random-village-names/c.gif\" width=\"1000\" height=\"578\"></p>\r\n</details>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<details><summary>Show Spoiler</summary>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/random-village-names/d.gif\"></p>\r\n</details>\r\n<p><br>------------------<br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>You may freely use this mod in any modpack, as long as the download remains hosted within the Modrinth ecosystem.</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><a style=\"font-size:18px;color:#008000\" href=\"https://serilum.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serilum.com</a> contains an overview and more information on all mods available.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Comments are disabled as I'm unable to keep track of all the separate pages on each mod.</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><br>For issues, ideas, suggestions or anything else there is the&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:14px;color:#008000\" href=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.issue-tracker\" rel=\"nofollow\">Github repo</a>.

          "body": "# Bountiful\n\n \n\n#### This requires [Kambrik](https://modrinth.com/mod/kambrik)!\n\n***\n\n#### Bountiful is a mod centered around a single block called the Bounty Board, and items which appear within: Bounties!\n\n***\n\n\n \n\n### Mechanics:\n\nBounty boards can be found throughout the world in villages, and they'll generate bounties inside of them. These bounties often ask for you to bring back an item, or kill some mobs in return for whatever rewards they're offering. If you can complete the bounty, you just have to bring it back to the bounty board and right click the board to redeem your rewards!\n\n\n### Decrees\n\nThere exists another item as well, called a Decree. A Decree determines what kind of bounties show up on a bounty board. For example, an Armorsmith's Decree makes it so that objectives and rewards related to armor show up on the board (leather, iron, chestplates, boots, etc). You can have up to three decrees on a bounty board at once, and it will mix and match objectives and rewards from all three when new bounties appear!\n\nYou can find new Decrees as rewards for certain bounties, or make your own. Crafting your own will create a random decree when you place it onto the board.\n\n### Bounty Tiers\n\nJust like items, bounties can have different tiers of rarity. Some bounty rewards are more rare than others, and bounties with higher rarity have a better chance of having these more rare rewards! Rarity follows the same pattern as in vanilla: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic.\n\n### Reputation\n\nAll bounty boards have their own value associated with them called \"Reputation\". As you turn in more bounties, this number goes up! The higher the reputation, the more often rare bounties show up on the bounty board. Some bounty rewards may not even show up until you reach high enough reputations.\n\n### Compat\n\nCurrently, I've added some support for some items from different Fabric mods. Feel free to suggest compat with other Fabric mods (but I may be stingy! For example: I'm not likely to add compat with items that involve a lot of time to craft, since it may break progression for some modpacks).\n\n \n\nI plan on adding more in the future!\n\n### Why?\n\nI originally made this mod so that I could be given some goals to accomplish, which would stave off boredom. It gives players something to do when they're bored, and a fun way to incentivize crafting items they'd otherwise maybe not be making!\n\n### Help\n\nUntil the wiki is complete, you can get help on [my Discord server.](https://discord.gg/TCsRjJ6vwZ)\n\n#### Credits:\n\nAkiShirai, for the wonderful bounty board block art.",

This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>",

It doesn't require all players to have the mod, but in that case they won't see the trims/dyes/etc.\n\nYou can *technically* obtain a trimmed/dyed elytra on a server without the mod. To do it create an elytra you want in creative singleplayer, save it in a hotbar and load on the server.\n\n## Trims\n\nPut any trim on your elytra just like any other armor. Mod provides a default resourcepack with all vanilla trims, but\nit can be expanded further.\n\n![A few trims](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/6e8e22627a57ea58dec99c451c7e7595faf0c5a0.png)\n\n## Banner patterns\n\nCombine your elytra with a banner to add intricate patterns and designs to your elytra.\n\n![Elytra with banner patterns](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/0327378aa65018c5f4e761c09c14fa94bb7e1d8d.png)\n\n## Dyeing\n\nIf you fancy something simplistic, dye your elytra however you want in a crafting table.\n\n![Dyed elytra](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/511e985762a518992f2bc140b34e9f5c104ade74.png)\n\n## Glowing\n\nCraft your elytra with a glow ink sac to make it glow in the dark.\n\n![Glowing trim](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/849d54736e4519df78678bf00a2077a528e866ad.png)\n\n## Mod compatibility\nThis lists mods Elytra Trims has explicit support for or known to work with. \nIt's likely to work with other mods, but you'll have to try it out.\n\n### Supports\n- Custom elytras:\n  - [Mythic Metals](https://modrinth.com/mod/mythicmetals)\n  - [Better End](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterend)\n  - [Mekanism](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism)\n- Extra trim patterns (Requires [Extensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-trims-extensions): \n  - [More Armor Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-armor-trims)\n  - [Geode+](https://modrinth.com/mod/geode-plus)\n  - [Frostiful](https://modrinth.com/mod/frostiful)\n  - [Ancient Aether](https://modrinth.com/mod/ancient-aether)\n  - [Alex's Caves](https://modrinth.com/mod/alexs-caves)\n- Elytra trinkets:\n  - [Elytra Slot](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot)\n  - [Elytra Trinket](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra_trinket)\n- Trim utilities:\n  - [All The Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/allthetrims)\n  - [Better Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/bettertrims)\n  - [Better Enchanting Table](https://modrinth.com/mod/bettersmithingtable)\n- Extra banners:\n  - [Additional Banners](https://modrinth.com/mod/additional-banners)\n  - [Archeology Banners](https://modrinth.com/mod/archaeology-banners)\n  - *And any other banner mods*\n\n### Conflicts\n- [Customizable Elytra](<https://modrinth.com/mod/customizable-elytra>) - overrides elytra renderer entirely, preventing Elytra Trims from working.\n\n## Customization\n\nWith resourcepack support, you can customize all the mod's features to your liking. Change the texture of your armor\ntrims or add a unique design to your elytra pattern with ease.\n\n## FAQ\n(Elytra Trims will be referred as ET)\n> I can't put trims/banner/dyes on the elytra!\n- If you're playing on a server, ET has to be installed there. On a paper/purpur/spigot or vanilla server you can use the datapack, but it will only work for trims.\n  If you're playing in singleplayer, it means ET is not loaded. Look up on YouTube how to install mods.\n\n> How do I use this mod on a server without it?\n- Client-side commands are planned, however for now the easiest way is to save trimmed elytra in a creative hotbar and load it on a server.  \n  Survival recipes are not possible without the mod installed on the server.\n\n> How can I remove trims/patterns/dye/glow from my elytra?\n- To remove patterns, dye and glow (all together), click with elytra on a cauldrow with water.  \nTrims can't be removed without other mods due to vanilla parity.\n\n> Trims look bad with capes!\n- Install [Mod Menu](<https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu>) and [YACL](<https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl>). In the mods tab find ET and open its settings. There you can disable rendering elytra capes. This is preferable to the vanilla cape setting because it will keep the cape while not wearing an elytra.\n\n## Roadmap\n- [x] Elytra trims (v1.0)\n- [x] Dyes and banners (v1.1.0)\n- [x] [YACL](<https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl>) support (v1.1.1)\n- [x] Multiversion build (v1.1.2)\n- [x] Glowing elytras (v1.1.4)\n- [x] Elytra cleaning (v1.1.4)\n- [x] Smithing table preview (v1.1.7)\n- [x] Runtime trim generation (v1.1.10)\n- [x] Runtime banner generation (v1.3.0)\n- [x] HD banner support (v1.3.0)\n- [x] 🐸 support (I'll regret this) (v2.0)\n- [x] Server-side config (v2.0)\n### TODO\n- [ ] Banner pattern preview\n- [ ] Modernfix dynamic resources support\n- [ ] Elytra glow preview\n",

          "body": "**Features**\n\n* Enhanced Sound Processing - sounds playing in 3d space will have a reverb effect based on the surrounding materials.\n\n\n* Individual Sound Control - Set key bind and activate in-game. Use this feature to block, cull, and control the volume at which sounds play. And as a bonus you can play the sound to hear it.\n\n\n* Biome sounds - Various atmospheric sounds that play based on biomes in the area. Seamless blending of sounds as the player moves throughout the world. (This does not replace the Minecraft feature of a singular biome background sound. Currently, the various biomes in the Nether use this capability, and Dynamic Surroundings does not have sound configurations for that dimension.)\n\n\n* Hot block effects such as flame jets over lava, and steam where water hits a hot block. Hot blocks are things like Lava and Magma.\n\n\n* Replace Minecraft's thunder sound with improved versions.\n\n\n* Various \"DS\" client side commands for dumping configuration information. (These are currently used by me while developing. I do plan on documenting at some point for general use.)\n\n\n* Custom debug HUD that can be accessed by key bind. Moves the Dynamic Surroundings clutter out of the traditional F3 display.\n\n**Optional Dependencies**\n\n* [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)\n* Missing footsteps?  Check out [Presence Footsteps](https://modrinth.com/mod/presence-footsteps)\n\n**Videos**\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/guMuLeG3lck\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KGFZ1zf9R2s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GbwaGX3JWeM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

It includes two built-in resource packs. The Default Connected Textures pack provides connected textures for glass, sandstone, and bookshelves, similar to the built-in connected textures provided by OptiFine. The Glass Pane Culling Fix pack culls faces between vertically stacked glass panes to make them look seamless with connected textures.\n\nFormally, Continuity implements the Continuity connected textures specification, Continuity emissive textures specification, and Continuity custom block layers specification. All of these are extensions of the corresponding OptiFine specification and were created to provide more features to resource pack authors. The documentation for the Continuity specifications can be found at the [Continuity wiki](https://github.com/PepperCode1/Continuity/wiki).\n\nAn official Forge version of Continuity is not planned at this time due to major technical differences between the Fabric and Forge APIs. An official Forge version of Continuity may be considered if these differences are minimized, possibly via the use of libraries.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n",

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)",

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)",

          "changelog": "[2.2]\n- fixed forge 1.21 & 1.20.6 compat\n- fixed issues when used with the Sodium 0.6 betas\n- Added a setting to make EMF reset all the vanilla part transforms of player models well before every render.\n  - Only applies if custom models are present for the player.\n  - This is not the typical behaviour however with how many mods alter player animations\n  - this setting vastly reduces the difficulty of player animation compatibility between mods and animation packs.\n  - E.G. player emote mods.\n  - This compatibility still requires work on the pack makers end.\n- added the `nbt(key,test)` boolean animation function it works exactly like the nbt random property such that `models.1.SaddleItem=exits:false` will be `nbt(SaddleItem,exists:false)`\n- added boolean animation variable `is_paused` true when the game is paused\n- added boolean animation variable `is_hovered` true when the client is looking at the entity or block entity position\n- added an option in model debug settings to only render models in debug mode when the mob is hovered over\n- added a setting to control whether EMF requires a 'base' model for model variation like OptiFine *(e.g. `pig2.jem` requires a `pig.jem` to work)*. This setting is now enabled by default to promote backwards compatibility and prevent confusion.\n- tweaked the `keyframe()` & `keyframeloop()` animation functions to use catmulrom spline interpolation for smooth transitions between keyframes, factoring in the previous and upcoming frames\n- fixed villager clothing and profession textures failing to render when a texture override is set in the model\n- fixed an issue with `chest_large.jem` due to how it has to be split into 2 half models in game, this removes the log spam about the missing left/right half and also somewhat fixes animations referring to the opposite side of the chest, you are still highly recommended to keep the left and right half animations separate. A config option has been enabled to toggle this fix in case of modded chest model conflicts.\n- fixed `slime_outer` models removing translucency when using texture overrides\n- fixed `is_swinging_right_arm` and `is_swinging_left_arm`\n- added `is_using_item` true when any item is being used, usually you can detect which arm via `is_swinging_right_arm` and `is_swinging_left_arm` but this is not reliable for all item usages\n- added `is_holding_item_right` and `is_holding_item_left` to detect if the entity is holding an item in the right or left hand, may not work for all entities that hold items, only tested with players\n- added vex charging to `is_aggressive` variable and also made it potentially more consistent with modded mobs\n- fixed variation for special secondary or backup models, like `outer_armor.jem`. or old directory modded models.\n- fixed the print animation methods accidentally printing during pre-validation\n- signs and boats now have optional override models, based on how vanilla separates every sign and boat variant into its own models, these are only identifiable by enabling model creation logging and seeing what they are called there, and if absent will fallback to the optifine defaults.\n- improved the file name and location displays in the config list of all models\n- added the emf 16x logo to the config gui to replace the full logo\n- improvements to texture overrides, emf now strips redundant texture declarations to improve runtime efficiency *(e.g. ignores `pig.png` declared in `pig.jem` as its redundant)*\n- fixed an issue with some entity animation values getting reset during entity feature layer rendering and not being restored correctly",

All previous features have been restored and some new ones added, with new development promised for the future on the opensource github profile!\n\n---\n\nExpect to see a more rich and immersive Minecraft world, one where Presence Footsteps adds new and more dynamic sounds for every block the player walks on. Every block has its own material assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.\n\n---\n\n- Wooden chests are creaky and old,\n- stone is dusty and rough.\n- Piston heads sound like wood, whilst their bodies are stone,\n- even cake sounds like you might destroy if you step in the frosting!\n- Tall grass and bristles make a dry, rustling sound as you step through them,\n- Magma sounds like it's literally cooking your souls!\n\n---\n\nNot only that, but the latest version includes step sounds for certain non-block entities:\n\n---\n\nShulkers make the same creaky box noises as Shulker boxes, boats sound like wood, and armour stands creak and produce a stone stepping sound as you walk on their stone slab base.\n\n ---\n\n## Sound Packs\n\nPresence Footsteps is **fully customisable** with resource packs. The mod by default includes a pack with its own sounds\nand material mappings for the vanilla blocks, however if you don't like those sounds or want to use your own, this pack can be turned off\nor used together with packs from the community.\n\nNote that you need **at least one** sounds pack enabled for the mod to function.\n\n![image](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/assets/6429283/9c50aa59-0f59-4324-aab7-cb360acac2ad)\n\n## Mod Support\n\nPresence Footsteps will attempt to figure out the sounds of modded blocks by looking at the vanilla material/sound types they use.\nIf your mod is using very unique sounds though, you can add mappings to your mod to directly control what sounds presence footsteps uses for your block by\nfollowing the [guide on our wiki](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators)\n",

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.dev/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

Using the power of Iris, we can finally have a colored lighting implementation in Minecraft shaders without getting the critical flaws seen in most others. Massive thanks to sixthsurge for the help.\n\nThis update also includes the addition of Colored Light Fog, shader-side Connected Glass, support for Minecraft 1.21, new sandstorm/snowstorm inspired weathers, support for Distant Horizons, and about 80 other things which can be found in the full list of changes at https://www.complementary.dev/changelogs",

(See images for an example)</p>\n<p>If you find some sort of compatibility issue, please let me know!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>You are free to use this mod in modpacks.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/S5NQjbXPnb\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yX0xrk0.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"68\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Problems, feature request, something else?&nbsp; Join us on Discord!</strong></p>",

          "body": "Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n",

Any picked up or equipped item is dropped back on the ground when the entity despawns to make sure you don't lose your items incase the mob picks them up after your death.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can still prevent mobs from naturally despawning by naming them with a name tag.\n<br>\n<br>\nAdded a config : <h2><code>config/letmedespawn.json</code></h2>\n\n```\n/lmd reload\n```\nTo reload the config ingame after editing.\n```\n/lmd add <mobName>\n```\nTo add mobs to the config.\n```\n/lmd remove <mobName>\n```\nTo remove mobs from the config.\n\nAll the commands update the mob list in realtime you dont need to run \"/lmd reload\" or restart the game after adding or removing mobs. \"**/lmd reload**\" is there incase you want to edit the config outside the game.\n<br>\n<br>\nThanks to Batdogduke64 for inspiration for the icon.\n<br>\n<br>\n</center>",

It's because of the 8:1 block ratio between the Nether and the Overworld. It's really weird though that you enter a portal in the overworld, and then when going back through where you came, come out of a different portal in the overworld. This mod fixes that issue.\n\nIt keeps track of what portals a player went through in order to ensure correct destinations when the player is going back through the same portals. The 1:8 ratio remains, portals just get smarter and remember where you came from.\n\n<p>\n    <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/balm\"> \n        <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/requires_balm.png\" alt=\"Requires Balm\" width=\"217\" height=\"51\" /> \n    </a>\n    <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/spacer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"21\" height=\"51\" /> \n    <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://discord.gg/VAfZ2Nau6j\">\n        <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/discord.png\" alt=\"Join our Discord\" width=\"51\" height=\"51\" />\n    </a>\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\n- As long as players use the same portal to return to the overworld, they will end up where they came from\n- Only needs to be installed on the server (but works in singleplayer as well)\n\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/netherportalfix_broken.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /> \n    <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/netherportalfix_fixed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" />\n</p>",

          "body": "Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n",

          "body": "## FastQuit\n\n### About this mod\n\nThis mod lets you return to the title screen early while your world is still saving in the background.\n\nDon't worry, the mod will wait for the world to finish saving when necessary, no data will be lost!\n\nThe world will show up on the world list, and you can even edit, delete or recreate it while it is still saving.\nThis is done by reusing the info from the still saving world.\n\nIn its current state this should be safe to do as measures for thread safety have been taken.\nIf you do somehow still encounter an issue, the worst thing to happen will be the action failing and Minecraft showing you a toast informing you of it.\n\n**If that happens, please [open an issue](#problems) with your .minecraft/logs/latest.log file attached!**\n\n### Join the Discord!\n\nIf you are interested in my mods or have any questions, you can join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6ZV8SF672)!\n\n### Configure\n\nTo configure the mod, open the config screen from [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or go to .minecraft/config/fastquit-config.txt.\n\nThere is currently three options to configure:\n\n**Show Toasts**:\n\nDetermines whether a toast gets shown when a world finishes saving.\n\n**Background Thread Priority**:\n\nSets the thread priority of the server when saving worlds in the background.\nThis is done to improve client performance while saving, but will make the saving take longer over all.\nValue has to be between 0 and 10, setting it to 0 will disable changing thread priority.\n\n**Render \"Saving world\" Screen**:\n\nWhen playing on high render distance, quitting the world can still take a bit because the client-side chunk storage has to be cleared.\nBy enabling this setting the \"Saving world\" screen will be rendered.\n\n**Show Saving Time**\n\nDetermines whether the time it took to save the world gets displayed on toasts and the world list.\nValue has to be between 0 and 2, with 0 never showing the time, 1 only on the toast and 2 also on the world list. In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n- Madis0 (Estonian)\n- notlin4 (Traditional Chinese)\n- BurrConnie (Ukrainian)\n- GodGun968 (Simplified Chinese)\n- ImVietnam (Vietnamese)\n- ishi-sama (French)\n- KAGUYA-1137 (Japanese)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nBecause of that there is currently no known incompatibilities.\n\nIf you do suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH_q7ZuCJs0\n\n<a href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/AIZISTRAL\" target=\"_blank\">![image](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/af63cb17-c373-4c82-aa1d-29beb7b045a9.png)</a>\n",

          "body": "### Note that the 1.21 version doesn't work on Forge yet, I'm working on solving this issue.\n\n\nDisables the usage data collection, aka telemetry, introduced in Minecraft 1.18 [(snapshot 21w38a)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w38a#main-content).\n\n\nThe feature previously existed from Minecraft 1.3.1 to 1.12 as [Snooper](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Snooper), but was removed in 1.13 [(snapshot 18w21a)](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-130179) as it did not comply with European Union's General Data Protection Regulations.\n\nIn 1.18 it was re-added. You would expect it would be done in a more compliant way... However, from my understanding of GDPR, this is even less compliant than the original Snooper was.  \nInstead of being anonymous/pseudonymous (at least, the ids in the snooper screen don't match my user id), it now sends the XUID, your Xbox user id, in plain text... which means this data can be traced back to your user.\n\nIt now sends the following data when loading a singleplayer world or connecting to a multiplayer server:\n\n* launcher identifier\n* user identitifer/XUID (**this can be used to identify you**)\n* client session id (changes on restart)\n* world session id (changes per world load, to be reused for later events)\n* game version\n* operating system name and version\n* Java runtime version\n* if client or server is modded (same information as on crash logs)\n* server type (single player, Realms or other)\n* game mode\n\nThis time [Mojang did not add a toggle](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-237493) for interested users to turn it off, though, so this mod fixes that by disabling the telemetry entirely.\n\n#### License\n\nThis mod is available under the CC0 license.",

          "body": "# Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (Fabric)\n\nA Fabric mod designed to improve the chunk performance of Minecraft.\n\n## So what is C2ME?\nC^2M-Engine, or C2ME for short, is a Fabric mod designed to improve the performance of chunk generation, I/O, and loading. This is done by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel. For the best performance it is recommended to use C2ME with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight).\n\n## What does C2ME stand for?\nConcurrent chunk management engine, it's about making the game better threaded and more scalable in regard to world gen and chunk io performance.\n\n## So what is C2ME not?\n**C2ME is currently in alpha stage and pretty experimental.**  \nAlthough it is usable in most cases and tested during build time, it doesn't mean that it is fully stable for a production server.  \nSo backup your worlds and practice good game modding skills.\n\n## Support\nOur issue tracker: [link](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric/issues)  \nOur discord server: [link](https://discord.gg/Kdy8NM5HW4)\n\n## Development builds\n**Note: Development builds may modify the config files in a way unreadable by previous versions. You may encounter crashes or config reset when rolling back to previous versions. Please always backup your config.**\n\nYou can find development builds here: https://ci.codemc.io/job/RelativityMC/job/C2ME-fabric  \nNote that these builds may contain more bugfixes and performance improvements but are less tested.  \nIf you have encountered any problems in release builds, give development builds a try before reporting. \n\n## FAQ\n- Q: Does this benefit client as well or only server?  \n  A: https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric/issues/116\n\n\n## More information\nCheck out the `README.md` here: https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric\n",

And, if you want to, animations like in [ChunkAnimator] or similar mods.\nNo more chunks appearing right in front of you out of nowhere! Unlike other mods for [Fabric], it works perfectly fine with [Sodium] and [Iris]! \n\n## Supported Minecraft versions\n- 1.18.x\n- 1.19.x\n- 1.20.x\n- 1.21.x\n\n## Dependencies\n- [Sodium] 0.4.x - 1.20.x versions\n- [Sodium] 0.5+ - 1.20.1+ versions\n\n# Compatibility with Forge\nIn order for the mod to work with Forge Mod Loader, you need to complete the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Install [Sinytra Connector]:\n- Install it from the official page by clicking the link above.\n\n### Step 2: Install [Embeddium]:\n- Install it from the official page by clicking the link above.\n\n### Step 3: Configure version overrides:\n- Navigate to the `config` folder inside **your Minecraft installation folder** (usually `.minecraft`). If there's no `config` folder, create one.\n- Open `fabric_loader_dependencies.json` inside `config` folder. If there's no `fabric_loader_dependencies.json` file, create one.\n- Paste the following text inside:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"chunksfadein\": {\n      \"+depends\": {\n        \"embeddium\": \">0.2.18+mc1.20.1\"\n      },\n      \"-depends\": {\n        \"sodium\": \"IGNORED\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n- Save the file and restart/launch the game.\n- Done!\n\n# Features\n## Showcase\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CanA5ADOis0\">\n</iframe>\n\n## Flexible config with Mod Menu support!\n<img src=\"https://github.com/kerudion/chunksfadein/blob/main/readme-assets/config.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">",
