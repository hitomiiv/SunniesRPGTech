          "body": "**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_HEADER.webp)**\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER1.webp)**\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is a mod that adds new and improved villages and pillager outposts to Minecraft.** It is available for both Forge and Fabric, and it works with most world-generation and structure mods. CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\nChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods. Full documentation is [here](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility)\n\nIt also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem.\nMods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n- **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n- **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n- **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default.\n- Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the CurseForge website.\n\nMod integration\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it's compatible. If it isn't yet, It will be. Read this [wiki page](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility) for details!\n\nYou can suggest more mods in my GitHub Issue section.\n</details>\n\n\n![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER5.webp)\n\n[![discord-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/discord-plural_64h.png)](https://discord.gg/JzYEw7PxQv) \n[![github-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/github-plural_64h.png)](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village) \n[![twitter-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/twitter-plural_64h.png)](https://twitter.com/ChoiceTheorem)\n[![youtube-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/youtube-plural_64h.png)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUSv0t-aWToQkpP5eonHmlA)\n\n**Credits**\n-----------\n\n*   Vichy0623 for codesigning the builds\n*   Robified for converting this datapack into a mod.\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_PROMO.webp)](https://bisecthosting.com/CT)",

In between continents are plenty of islands to keep your sailing interesting. When you spawn in your world, you are guarenteed to always spawn on a medium-sized continent, which averages around 1k blocks in size.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

This is important!\n\nThe version support numbers are strict! <br>\nIf a version says it supports MC 1.18.1 it will NOT work on 1.18.2! <br>\n\nAnd: the mod is still in alpha. Things may change, break, crash or otherwise go wrong. You have been warned! <br>\nAlthough if you have problems feel free to leave an issue on the project's GitLab.\n<br> \n \n\n \n## FAQ:\n\n**Q: Forge or Fabric?** <br>\nA: MC 1.20.6 and newer - NeoForge and Fabric are both in the same jar. <br>\nMC 1.20.4 and older - Forge and Fabric are both in the same jar. \n\n**Q: Shaders?** <br>\nA: Yes, but only with certain shaders. <br>\n- Optifine: DH partially works with forward rendered shaders.\n- Iris (and equivalent ports): DH 2.1.0+ only works with Iris 1.7+ and only with shaders built with DH support in mind. \n  - DH 2.0 and older don't work with Iris.\n\n**Q: Does this work with player created structures?** <br>\nA: Yes.\n\n**Q: Is there multiplayer support?** <br>\nA: Yes.\nAlthough currently the mod is only client side so you have to explore chunks for the mod to use them.\n\n<br>\n\n### Extended FAQ:\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/1-general/General\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-general.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/2-problems-and-solutions/Problems-and-Solutions\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-mod-support.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/4-mod-support/Mod-Support\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-problem.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a>\n\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Discord:\nJoin our Discord for news, updates, and help:\ndiscord.com/invite/xAB8G4cENx\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Support us:\n\nIf you want to help with development, join our discord and let us know!\n\nOtherwise if you can't help with development but still want to support Distant Horizons, check out our donation page:\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/distanthorizons",

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).\n\nThe downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods` folder.",

Helps in maintaining sanity :)<br><br>Initially created to hide the warning in my own development environment, and thought it couldn't hurt to release it as a feature for in production as well.

This is __not__ required, but it allows all items to have their own beautiful textures.\n- Incendium is **not** compatible with Amplified Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nIncendium adds 8 unique biomes to the nether. Do you bravely venture through the perilous **Quartz Flats**, wander the mysterious **Withered Forest**, or battle your way through the steep **Infernal Dunes**? Each biome has a unique personality and story to tell. With unique block themes in each biomes, opportunities for new farms for technical players, 3D biomes, and stunning terrain, there is truly something for everyone.\n\n### Structures\nTo compliment the lovely biomes, there are 9+ structures for you to explore and conquer. In the Ash Barrens, the **Foribdden Castle** stands forbodingly, with courageous Piglins defending its treasured loot - one of the largest and complex random structures in Minecraft! Alternatively, you can conquer the ominous **Sanctum** with its illagers defending dark secrets and strong weapons. The skeleton chef Torte defends his **Quartz Kitchen**, and the Withered Director his **Nether Reactor**. What will you conquer first?\n\n### Items\nEvery mob you defeat and structure you conquer has its reward - Incendium pays you handsomely with both rick loot and custom weapons! Defeating the Hovering Inferno could earn you the **Trailblazer** - a flame-spewing bow. A high damage, but taxing **Greatsword of Sacrifice** hides within the Forbidden Castle's walls, along with the helpful **Hefty Pickaxe**. Or maybe you prefer to find the **Hazmat Suit** to protect you from all types of poisonous attacks. There are over 25 items to forge your own playstyle with!\n\n### Mobs\nNo datapack would be complete without its own mobs to fight you. The Toxic Heap is home of the agile **Toxic Slimes**, and the Withered Forest is haunted by the **Restless Spirits**. On the other hand, you could go on a rescue missue to save the **Ghastling** from the Abandoned Tower - in return, it will defend you from Ghasts. If none of this is challenging, you can summon the all-powerful **Hovering Inferno** boss for a difficult and dirty battle.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

So many things broke in 1.20.5, and it was simply not worth my time. Thank you!\n\n- Updated to 1.20.5 (supports 1.20-1.20.6)\n- Now supports Neoforge\n- Scout's Battle Helm now uses an emerald Sentry trim\n- Custom banners and potions have been renamed, or given a name if there was not one already\n- Custom banners and potions are now split into their own loot tables for easier use\n- New particles for Necrotic and Radiation shields, and they should trigger their effects properly\n- In 1.20.5 only, Ghastling now appears as a mini-Ghast\n- Voltaic Trident should now work properly\n- Holy Wrath is removed from a loot table it shouldn't have been in\n- Fixed issue where Piglin Villagers would not move\n- Greatsword of Sacrifice's self-damage has been rebalanced\n- Restless Spirits *should* no longer starve to death\n- Fixed issue where a new marker entity would generate on every single world load\n- Fixed a malformed JSON strings that could spawm console on Spigot-based servers",

          "description": "Sodium addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo",
          "body": "Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.",

You against the void - nothing more than that.\nNullscape boosts the End's height to 384 blocks, and makes full use of 1.18's modern features to generate incredibly varied terrain. You'll find everything from shattered islands, to floating valleys, to crystallized peaks! Different regions of the End - on very large scales - have different properties and feelings to allow for almost infinite variation in terrain shapes. From sponge-like porous terrain, to stretched alien landscapes, to stacked rounded islands; you'll find new and interesting terrain no matter how far you go.\n__ __\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n",

Meaning that everything that's added is something which could also be built in vanilla creative.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nRoguelike Dungeons started as a project to enhance and build on the experience of the original Minecraft box style dungeons by linking rooms together with corridors and stairwells.\n\nThe design of these dungeons was inspired by the 404 Challenge, and Vechs' SuperHostile maps. Amnesia the Dark Descent inspired the tone and themes throughout.\n\nThe title comes from the genre of old dungeon crawlers by the same name.\n\n## Roguelike Challenge\n\nTry to enter a dungeon on your first day and don't leave until you've explored the entire structure. The loot and difficulty are designed to make this a rewarding experience.\n\n## Commands and Gamerules\n\nRoguelike Dungeons generate in the world naturally, however you can directly control the placement if you wish.\n\nThe \"roguelike\" command can be used to generate a dungeon at the caller's position by calling \"roguelike dungeon here\". This command will be expanded later.\n\nThe \"roguelikeDungeonsGenerate\" Gamerule (defaults to true) can be used to disable natural generation.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why beta? Is this mod stable?\nThis mod is stable as far as I know. I'll remove the beta status when core systems are no longer under construction. Soon.\n\n### How do I find the dungeon? Does locate work?\nThe locate command does not work because these dungeons are not generated as part of the vanilla structure system. You'll usually find them near villages, so locate those instead.\n\n### Can I add this mod to an existing world?\nYes. New dungeons will naturally spawn in new chunks. If you want to add a dungeon to old terrain you can do so using the \"roguelike\" command.\n\n### What happens if I remove this mod?\nNothing will break if you remove this mod after generating dungeons. Mob Spawners will no longer generate fancy mob equipment, and that's about it.\n\n### Do players who join a multiplayer world need to have this mod installed?\nNo. This mod is entirely vanilla compatible, and does not need to be installed on the client side.\n\n### Can I add this mod to a modpack?\nYes. Do whatever you like.\n\n### Can I change the loot?\nCurrently, no. Eventually I'll add a vanilla style loot table option.\n\n### Can I add my own rooms?\nNo, this dungeon is generated procedurally. It's not possible to add content without changing the source code. If it were easy to add this capability I would.\n",

          "body": "**This mod is the result of thousands of hours of development, and is made possible thanks to players like you.** If you would like to show a token of your appreciation for my work, and help support the development of Sodium in the process, then consider [buying me a coffee](https://jellysquid.me/donate).\n\n<a href=\"https://caffeinemc.net/donate\"><img src=\"https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3\" width=\"180\"/></a>\n\n---\n\n<center>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/5ca2e8f6c72f3d543dd3dc95b706964c5678d80e.png\" alt=\"Sodium 0.4 Comparison\"></img>\n <p>\n   <!-- This paragraph is load bearing, and ensures a margin is added before the following Markdown -->\n </p>\n</center>\n\nSodium is a powerful rendering engine and optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves performance and graphical quality. It boasts great compatibility with the wider mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is available for multiple mod loaders, but we recommend using [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) for the most simple and lightweight experience. If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed your mod loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.",

          "body": "![Tectonic logo](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/3797bb32f05af523d3ec2a76b6c3c4f9187fac50.png)\n\nWelcome to **Tectonic**, a world generation project that aims to transform how terrain is shaped.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nTectonic is available as a datapack and as a Fabric/Neoforge mod. Forge mod versions are discontinued starting with 1.20.5.\n\nIf you are using Terralith with Tectonic **as datapacks**, install [Terratonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terratonic) instead of Tectonic. If you are using the two projects **as mods**, you don't need to install anything extra.\n\n## Description\n\nTectonic makes several large, impactful changes to worldgen.\n\nFeatures labeled with 🎚️ can be toggled on and off in the mod version's config file.\n\n### Mountain Ranges\n\nThe way mountains generate has been completely overhauled, with them forming huge mountain ranges that can stretch for thousands of blocks. These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\nThe mod version's config file provides several options for customizing mountain generation:\n- `terrain_scale`: Vertically scales terrain, higher values = more extreme terrain heights\n- `horizontal_mountain_scale`: Horizontally scales mountains, lower values = less steep mountain slopes\n- `increased_height`: Enables a built-in datapack that increases the Overworld build and generation height to 640\n\n### Underground Rivers 🎚️\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn some steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as \"lerp\" issues - is gone. In previous Tectonic versions this meant that Windswept biomes were removed from generation, but in v2 and above they will once again generate.\n\n### Dunes 🎚️\n\nSmooth desert dunes will generate in some Desert biomes, giving Deserts a special look to them.\n\n### Deeper Oceans 🎚️\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!\n\nIf the mod version is installed, vanilla Ocean Monuments will generate deeper to compensate for the deeper oceans.\n",

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

          "body": "# Welcome to William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld for 1.20.1 and higher!\n\n![William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54945257/205379797-def647a9-8d28-4c90-80b9-08d8a4a0e082.png)\n\n## Introduction\nThis mod attempts to recreate the familiar landscapes you know and love in a way that creates a more realistic and atmospheric world.\n\n### Why are there now 2 WWOO versions?\nWe decided to split WWOO in two parts, one with new biomes added ([Expanded Exosphere](https://modrinth.com/mod/expanded-ecosphere)) and one which only overhauls existing biomes (WWOO).\n\n## Key Features\n### Overhauled Biomes\nEvery biome has been reworked to provide a more realistic and immersive environment. Say goodbye to the standard biomes and welcome an enhanced world filled with diverse landscapes and exciting adventures.\n\n### Biome Transitions\nDiscover the new transitions between biomes, that eliminate jarring shifts between environments, allowing for a more natural world flow. Check out this [example picture](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/II7t6llZ/images/415ed50637330b1c39d463076af7f2ab5fe9a283.png) in the Gallery.\n\n### Compatibility with Vanilla Clients\nWorried about compatibility issues with your friends? Fear not! Overhauled Overworld exclusively uses vanilla blocks, ensuring that you can install this mod on your server, and your friends can join with their vanilla clients. This makes for a hassle-free and enjoyable multiplayer experience.\n\n## Enhance Your Experience\n- **Navigable Rivers**: Improve your river experience with this travel-friendly add-on. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/navigable-rivers-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-2/)\n\n- **Cliffs and Coves**: Improve your world with better coastlines using this add-on. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/cliffs-and-coves-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-2/)\n\n- **Towering Tepuis**: Add a forbidding and mysterious area of adventure to your world. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towering-tepuis-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-4-1-20-6/)\n\nIf you prefer a datapack over a mod, click [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/4pbhwMQz) to download the datapack version of WWOO.\n\n\n## Join Our Community\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect with fellow adventurers, we invite you to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/yJng7sC44x).

Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work. Feel free to ask me any questions on Discord!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"http://sbisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3wUhXJJ.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Nether Fortresses is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-ocean-monuments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Ocean Monuments</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Witch Huts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-witch-huts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Witch Huts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li>Infernal Expansion, Better Nether & other Nether biome mods</li>\n<li>Apocalyptic Fortress: The AF fortress will spawn alongside the Better Fortress</li>\n<li>Bygone Nether: Better Fortresses will spawn instead of Bygone Nether's enhanced vanilla fortress</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it! Seriously!</p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3LW5j7DAdE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zMhFcqM.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better End Island is intended to be compatible with as many mods as possible.

Everything should still work properly though.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Progressive Bosses</b><ul><li>Extra cage placement may be a little scuffed in older versions of Progressive Bosses. Make sure you're on the latest version!</li><li><i>/end_island reset</i> command may not properly reset fight history/progress on Progressive Bosses' side of things. If you use this command, you should also run <i>/progressivebosses difficulty set <player> dragon 0</i></li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Better End</b><ul><li>Since the island is smaller than in vanilla, obsidian spikes will spawn closer to the center</li><li>If any spikes are missing or you have any other issues with generation, try using the <i>/end_island reset</i> command while in the End</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Nullscape</b><ul><li>Completely compatible on 1.19+. <b>Not compatible on 1.18.2.</b></li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Savage Ender Dragon</b><ul><li>The crystals Better End Island adds in the center may rarely respawn, if crystal respawning from Savage Ender Dragon is enabled.

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility. However, mods trying to change the same mechanics will never be compatible (such as dual wielding mods).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## 🤝 Partnerships\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWe partnered up with the following mods, to fully utilise the JSON API of Better Combat:\n\n- [MC Dungeons Weapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdw)\n\n- [MCDoom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdoom)\n\n- [MedievalWeapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/medievalweapons)\n\n- [Mythic Metals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mythicmetals)\n\n- [Simply Swords](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-swords)\n\n- [Spectrum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spectrum)",

You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.",

This is the same mod written by genandnic of [Wall Jump](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wall-jump-fabric), but it's for 1.19.4.\n\n<font size=\"10\">\nWall-to-wall platforming in Minecraft! \n</br></br>\n<font size=+1>\n\nWith this mod installed, players can perform new movements that will allow them to navigate their environment more dynamically.\n\nWall jumping allows players to jump off walls to gain additional height or reach areas that might otherwise be out of reach. To perform a wall jump, the player must jump towards a wall and then jump again off of the wall at the right moment. Timing is crucial, as the player must hit the wall at the correct angle and jump off at the right time to gain the maximum height.\n\nDouble jumping allows players to jump twice in quick succession, providing even more mobility and allowing them to reach even higher places. To perform a double jump, the player must jump once, then jump again while still in midair. This technique is helpful in reaching higher ledges or avoiding obstacles in the player's path.\n\nPlease see the following on how to do the various actions ingame!\n\n<b>Wall Cling</b>: Jump towards a wall and hold the wall jump key (LSHIFT). \n\n<b>Wall Jump</b>: While wall clinging, keep holding W and let go of LSHIFT to wall jump.\n\n<b>Double Jump</b>: Optional mid-air jump that you can use to your advantage.\n\n</font></font></font></font></center>",

Simply hold the \"excavate\" key(bound to ~ by default,configurable) while mining a block and all the connected blocks will be mined as well, saving you the time from mining each individually.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/fAD8Jrt4HVqn8BEHF2/giphy.gif \"\")\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/WTRhcX7JxVw2mpIiUW/giphy.gif \"\")\n\nDiggus Maximus is highly configurable, featuring:\n\n*   Automatically picking up the mined blocks\n*   maximum number of blocks to mine\n*   max distance from start block to spread\n*   the ability to excavate with your hand\n*   Tool durability\n*   Player exhaustion\n*   A blacklist/whitelist\n*  Auto stopping before tool breaks\n*  Support for mining BlockTags\n\nDiggus Maximus is required to be installed on both the client, and the server. While playing on a server, the server config will override the clients \n\n",

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at [@BlayTheNinth](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth).",

The book is still WIP and has no recipe, but you can get and read it in creative mode  \n- [NoMoreGlowingPotions](https://modrinth.com/mod/nomoreglowingpots) is highly suggested to appreciate the actual potion colors, instead of the weird glowing effect that makes them all look the same.  \n\n## Potions and Recipes\n  \n  \nEvery single potion recipe can be individually disabled in the config file.  \nAll potions in this mod are brewed in the vanilla Brewing Stand with vanilla items and have the standard splash, lingering and arrow variants; some of them may also have redstone and glowstone enhancements.  \nNot all potions are available in fabric yet. I'm slowly working on it, don't worry!  \n \n## Brewing Stand Tweak\n  \n  \nThere are two kind of people in this world, those who like the blaze powder requirement for brewing stands, and those who don't. I belong to the latter. A config now allows brewing stands to be powered by a fire underneath, or really anything made of fire/lava material. It is kinda slow, but I feel like it is a good compromise for fuel, it makes so much more sense to me. Note that blaze powder will still work, this is just an alternative. The option can be turned off in the config.  \nHeat sources and conductive materials can be specified through the tags `extraalchemy:heat_source` and `extraalchemy:heat_conductor`.\n \n## Vials\n  \n  \nVials are my version of a stackable potion system. Craft a splash potion with an empty vial to get a vial of the potion, or right click an empty vial to fill with the first potion found in your inventory. Vials apply the effect on the player immediately and can be stacked up to 16. To craft an empty vial make the same recipe of a glass bottle in the bottom rows and put a flint in the top-center slot.\n\n## Potion Bag\n\n\nThe potion bag is a handy way to carry around your potions. You can store any drinkable brew inside, and select one type to have quick access to. To access the bag interface shift-right click the bag. Using a simple right click will administer the potion, or it will select the next available type when you run out of the selected one.  \nA keybind can be used while holding a bag to decide what happens when a potion runs out: deselect everything, select next potion, or keep unavailable potion selected.  \nYou can also dye them like leather armor! (They should retain their settings and inventory in doing so, too)\n\n## Potion Rings\n\n\nThe potion rings are a way to have a semi-persistent potion effect. Combine an empty ring with any valid vanilla potion to get the corresponding ring.   \nThis feature can be disabled or configured through the config file.  \nThe ring will apply the potion over time to the wearer, and every available potion is customized to allow different xp costs for more powerful potions.  \nEvery potion also has a customized duration when applied, and XP cost and renewal time can be defined separatedly (aka: no more flashing night vision potion, as the renewal time is at 18s, making the potion go from 36s to 18s, instead of waiting for it to go all the way to 0).  \nNew potions with custom XP cost, level, duration and renewal time can be defined through the vanilla recipe system which is automatically fetched from the server on connection. [Example](https://github.com/zabi94/ExtraAlchemy/tree/1.16-fabric/src/main/resources/data/extraalchemy/recipes/ring_recipes).  \nUsing the same name of a mod-defined json, and setting the output to be a \"useless potion\" (water/awkward/mundane/thick...) will disable that ring.  \nWhen Trinkets is installed, rings will work in the ring slot!  \nYou can create your own rings through [this tool](https://zabi94.dev/ring_gen/)\n\n\n## Potion Tooltip Icons\n\nSince 1.18.2 there's the option to see the potion icons on the tooltips of potion-bearing items, like drinking/splash/lingering potions, tipped arrows, vials, potion rings and loaded potion bags:\n\n![potion icon image](https://zabi94.dev/mc_screenshots/tooltip_icons.png)\n\n\n## Bug Support\n  \n1) Install the latest available version for your minecraft version and try again   \n2) If the bug still persist, open a new issue **on Github**  \n\n\n \n## Will you port to...?\n  \n- Past versions: No. Stop asking.\n- Future versions: Sure, on fabric, when I have time. Keep in mind I have a life and a full time job.\n- Forge: No. [Gretchen, stop trying to make Forge happen, it's not going to happen](https://youtu.be/Pubd-spHN-0?t=2). Not even if someone else offers. _I don't want to_ have a forge version.\n\n\n## Currently supported versions:  \n- 1.19.2 and before: No  \n- **1.19.3**: Supported  \n- **1.20 snapshots**: development will begin shortly\n\n\n## Modpack policy\n  \n  \nYou can redistribute the jar **as part of modpacks** if you include a link redirecting to either this page or Curseforge's page.   \n\nDo not redistribute the mod as a single jar, please.\n\nAt the current time, multiple websites are violating this policy, so if you downloaded the mod from them or you visualized their ad-gates, you are actively supporting this practice; please, try to access the files from the original source.  \nJust to mention a few that you should avoid:  \n\n- minecraft-forum .net\n- 9minecraft .net\n- ign .com\n- 8minecraft .com\n- 9minecraft-mods.blogspot .it\n- minecraft-inside .ru\n\n[Read more here!](http://stopmodreposts.org) (You can also download and install a browser plugin from this link, it will help you block malicious sites)\n\n\n\n*Thanks to Vazkii and wiiv for kindly providing the original textures for the potion effects, and to she_is_long for reworking all of them (+item textures) to the new Minecraft art style! &lt;3*\n\n ",

It provides many of the same features as [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) while many new conveniences, like server-client config synchronization, added on top\n\n - A fully automatic [registration system](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/registration/) that is designed to be as generic as possible. It is simple and non-verbose to use for basic registries, yet the underlying API tree is flexible and can also be used for many custom registration solutions\n\n - [Item Group extensions](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/item-groups/) which allow for sub-tabs inside your mod's group as well as a host of other features like custom buttons, textures and item variant handling\n\n - A fully-featured [networking layer](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/networking/) with fully automatic serialization, handshaking to ensure client compatibility and a built-in solution for triggering parametrized particle events in a side-agnostic manner\n\n - Client-sided particle helpers that allow for easily composing multi-particle effects\n\n - Rich text translations, allowing you to use Minecraft's text component format in your language files to provide styled text without any code\n\n***\n\nowo is documented in two main ways:\n\n - There is rich, detailed JavaDoc throughout the entire codebase\n - There is a wiki with in-depth explanations and tutorials for most of owo's features over at https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/features/",

In its base configuration it serves as an easy way to increase ore yield, but everything is data-driven allowing you to add new forges and recipes as you please. These data-driven features are mostly intended for mod and modpack authors, especially because new forge types can only be added through other mod-datapacks or global configuration files. \n\n\n---\n\nBy default there are three forge tiers, each with different fuel capacity and speed. They're all made from different stone-like materials, you can look them up on the wiki.\n\n![Forge Tutorial](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/0ca4651a23fb13f1add7bed2820bfb2059e3e2bc.png)\n \n\nAll controllers are crafted according to this pattern, with the outer ring of blocks corresponding to that controller's material. To construct a forge, simply follow the convenient guide above this piece of text using any combination of blocks that forge type supports.\n\n​\n\n<center><img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5df27e031fe7bba7fd361683dbe662c95633d7bb.png\" /></center>\n\n![GUI](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/8c88d3b6f3d3286efb83b29bb772eba52372f7fc.png)\n\n## Development Discord:\nJoin this is if you have any issues or need help adding new content\n\n[![Discord](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/372/487/wraith.png)](http://discord.gg/Pa5wDVm8Xv)",

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n### Credits\n\nIn certain older versions, this library used to bundle typetools; you can find its license [here](https://github.com/jhalterman/typetools/blob/master/LICENSE.txt \"\")",

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n",

          "body": "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochotonida/artifacts/1.18/src/main/resources/logo.png)\n\nSome older versions of this mod can be found on curseforge: [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts) /  [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts-fabric)\n\nArtifacts is a mod which aims to make exploration more rewarding by adding various powerful items that cannot be crafted.\n\nThe items added by this mod can be found in chests in vanilla structures, through archaeology, or can very rarely be found worn by entities. All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items and their descriptions can be found in the images tab. Sn up-to-date list of where each item can be found is available on the wiki on GitHub.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack. Information about the data formats used can be found on the [Trinkets wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Trinkets-Data-Formats).\n\n#### _Which mod are you using to put artifacts on armor stands?_\n\n[Curious Armor Stands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curious-armor-stands \"\").\n\n#### _Can I still find artifacts if I add this mod to a world that has already been generated?_\n\nCampsites and mimics will only spawn in chunks that were generated after you downloaded the mod. You will still be able to find artifacts in unopened chests in existing chunks.\n\n#### [Forge] _Whey I try to open the Curios menu to equip my artifacts, nothing happens._\n\nSome server plugins can cause this (https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/issues/131). If you're using plugins, verify that this issue also happens in a Forge-only environment before asking for help.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/298798089068609537/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/87pXJadaRr)",

This allows the player to gain the benefits of the totem without the hassle of needing to remember to\nhold the totem or the need to sacrifice a useful hotbar/inventory slot to keep one around.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n",

While the elytra is in this slot, it will grant the same flight capabilities as if it was in your chestplate slot.

          "body": "Radiant Gear is a mod that acts as a simple compatibility bridge between [Curios API](https://modrinth.com/mod/curios) or [Trinkets API](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) and dynamic light mods. With this mod, items in accessory slots will inherit the dynamic lighting behavior defined by the\ndynamic lighting mod. As an example, if a held torch would provide dynamic lighting, then installing this mod will cause\ntorches placed in accessory slots to also provide dynamic lighting.\n\n**Please note: This mod does NOT add any content or slots on its own. In order to gain more slots or assign items into\nslots, users will need to either add a mod that adds that kind of content or add it themselves through the [Curios\nAPI configuration](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users) or the [Trinkets API configuration](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide).**\n\n**Compatible Mods**\n\n- [Dynamic Lights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-lights)\n- [Lucent](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lucent)\n- [Magnesium/Rubidium Dynamic Lights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamiclights-reforged)\n- [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau)\n- [RyoamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/ryoamiclights)\n- [Embeddium++](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddiumplus)\n- [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights)\n\nNote: This mod's sidedness depends on the dynamic lighting mod used. For example, if using Lucent then this mod is\nclient-side only because Lucent is client-side only. On the other hand, if using Dynamic Lights then this mod is\nrequired on both client and server because Dynamic Lights is required on both as well.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n",

Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://optifine.alternatives.lambdaurora.dev/)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire! Fire! Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p style=\"color: red\">Please, when you write the name of this mod, don't add spaces.</p>**\n\n[fabric]: https://fabricmc.net\n[Mod loader: Fabric]: https://img.shields.io/badge/modloader-Fabric-1976d2?style=flat-square&logo=data:image/png;base64,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\n[Fabric API]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api \"Fabric API CurseForge page\"\n[ModMenu]: https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu\n[Sodium]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium \"Sodium CurseForge page\"\n[Canvas]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer \"Canvas CurseForge page\"\n[LambdAurora Discord]: https://discord.gg/abEbzzv\n",

The **current season** is defined by the **world time** (using `/time set 0` will reset to day 1 of spring). Each season has its own changes; during the spring, biomes will mostly try to match their original characteristics.\n\nThe mod has 2 components:\n- **Server:** If installed on the server biomes will have different temperatures. (this enables weather changes like snowing and block freezing in the winter). The server component also contains seasonal crops, allowing crops to grow at different speeds according to the season.\n- **Client:** If installed on the client biomes will have different colormaps according to the current season. This is just a visual change and it'll not physically impact your world in any form.\n\nTo get the full experience it's recommended that you install the mod on both the server and the client.\n\n### Seasonal Biomes\n\nBiomes have **different temperatures** depending on the current **season**:\n\n- Cold Biomes will have rain in the summer\n- Temperate Biomes will have snow in the winter\n- Tropical Biomes will have a steady season all year round\n- Hot Biomes will have a rainy season in the winter\n\nDepending on the **original** temperature/precipitation of the **biome**, this behavior can change. \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdYBkgC.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gH5seb5.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qs600XR.gif\">\n</center>\n\n### Seasonal Crops\n\nCrops will grow at **different speeds** depending on the current **season**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75gqPqS.png\">\n</center>\n\nEach **individual crop** will have a **pre-configured** growth **speed** for one of the four seasons, this is controlled by a **datapack** and can be changed by the user if they want.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dR4OYPT.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)",

An item that **scans** the right-clicked **block** and shows what season is currently affecting it.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nApart from the greenhouse resources, Fabric Seasons: Extras adds **other blocks** such as:\n- Season Detector - **Redstone component** that outputs a redstone **signal** based on the **current season** and the block's configuration.\n- Season Calendar - Helpful **item/black** that can show you the season **progress** and how many **days** are left until the next season.\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)",

By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) to help you learn the basics!\n\n \n**📝 FAQ**\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q. How does this different from the other existing Farmer's Delight Fabric?**\n\nA. This port's main focus has been on simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod. This meant that only minor changes were made to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\nPackage names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This means that FD addons can now easily be ported from Forge to Fabric with, ideally, no change at all as all the package names are the same.\n\n[A list of differences can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Differences.md)\n\n**Q. Will existing addons work for this?**\n\nA. While porting existing Forge addons to Fabric will be trivial, already existing Fabric addons made for the old Fabric port will NOT work and they will have to update to reflect the new package structure.\n\n[A list of supported addons and integrations can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Addons_And_Integrations.md)\n\nFeel free to ask for more compat layers, however, they will only be done if they are simple enough to be able to be done, anything more complicated and you're best to wait for a developer to support Farmer's Delight Refabricated or just accept that they might not, it's really up to them.\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Will I keep old blocks from the other FD port?**\n\nA. The mods use the same IDs so yes.\n\n**Q. Will addons for the other port be updated to use this one instead?**\n\nA. That depends on them. Updating/porting a Forge addon is trivial but this will still take a bit of time and depends on the individual modder. So please be patient and don't harrass modders.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight Refabricated is currently being updated for 1.20+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No. This mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\nPlease, do NOT ask for backports!\n</details>",

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing a Recipe Viewer mod. Create has full support for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>, <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/rei\">REI</a>, and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\">EMI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create/issues\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qPmjSXy.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrKV2QTuyGcv4E3eSJpBiYA/playlists\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/L1bU9mr.png\" width=\"160\" /></a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/hmaD7Se\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uf6V9ZX.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Supporting-the-Project\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fHQ45KR.png\" width=\"227\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Development\n\n<p>Find out about supported versions and what's currently in the works in <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/dev.status\">this dedicated wiki page.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Developers\n\n<p>simibubi, Jozufozu, Pepper, Zelophed, gamez7, Grimmauld, Snownee</p>\n\n### Porters\n\n<p>Pepper, Tropheus Jay, AlphaMode, smellypengu, Aeiou, Whangd00dle, YTG123</p>\n\n### Artists\n\n<p>Kryppers, voxel_dani, LeastReality, vectorwing</p>\n\n### Special thanks to\n\n<p>tterrag, evanthebruce, D'Arcy Olla</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Localization\nTranslations may be unfinished or out of date.\n\n* en_us (English US)\n* de_de (German) by Vexatos, Azratosh, SaurierZockt, DreiMu, muffinbarde, Peatral\n* nl_nl (Dutch) by Prusias\n* fr_fr (French) by Kiro, dindin-glitch\n* zh_cn (Chinese) by TUsama, BigDaleAHA, gloomybanana, Snownee, MacrousHyucen, Demonese, StarFish\n* zh_tw (Chinese, Traditional) by dunois\n* ru_ru (Russian) by sqcode06, Hanqnero, sirabein, pgkrol, Alepod\n* pt_br (Brazilian) by lucassabreu, vyhi\n* jp_jp (Japanese) by MORIMORI0317, CKenJa, RakuGaki-MC\n* ko_kr (Korean) by qkrehf2, red1854th\n* it_it (Italian) by Masterlupo, Chexet48\n* es_es (Spanish) by FrannDzs, muriplz\n* es_mx (Spanish, Mexico) by JohanIvan\n* es_cl (Spanish, Chile) by Alonsinwhat\n* pl_pl (Polish) by joker876\n* ro_ro (Romanian) by andreutu",

This Minecraft mod is written for\nthe Fabric & Quilt mod loaders for modern versions of Minecraft (1.18.2+) - Changes tend to focus on making it more\nextendable, as well as improving compatibility with other mods. Improvements to older features are also being sprinkled\nin from time to time.\n\nThis mod's official project pages can be found below:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod-fabric)\n- [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-restitched) \n\nFabric compatibility *comes first* due to its current adoption in the Minecraft Modding community, however Quilt is\nsupported by the mod currently! In the case that either Mod Loader encounters a problem, make sure to\n[submit a bug report!](https://github.com/squeeglii/grapplemod-restitched)\n\n\n\n## 🔗 Origins\n\nThis repository is an unofficial fork of Yyon's [Grappling Hook Mod](https://github.com/yyon/grapplemod), which was \nwritten to support the Forge mod loader. It has a history stretching back all the way to its MCreator roots in 2015,\nimplementing improved physics, upgrades, and better integrations since.\n\nYou can find the links to its official project pages (and the downloads) here:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod/versions)\n- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-mod) (More up-to-date? Last checked 19/6/23)\n\nThis fork's root stems from the 1.19.2 version of v13, created under the original scope of providing an alternative\nunder the Fabric & Quilt ecosystems, as well as updating these ports to future versions. With the original scope met,\nfuture versions now focus on enhancements on top of the original work, as well as perpetual support into the future.\n\n\n## ☎️ Contact\n\n- **Discord:** [Support Server or](https://discord.gg/94c45XagEH) @CG360\n- **GitHub:** [/squeeglii](https://github.com/squeeglii)\n\n\n## 📜 Credits:\n\nSee [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](/ATTRIBUTIONS.md) for credits with attached licenses, such as for sounds and code.\nThere are some smaller credits also found on [the original Forge repository!](https://github.com/yyon/grapplemod/)\nwhich have been omitted here.\n\n### Technical Contributions\n\n- **Original Mod** - Yyon\n- **Textures** - Mayesnake\n- **Forge 1.18+** - Nyfaria\n- **Fabric/Quilt 1.18.2+** - CG360\n\n### Translations\n\n- **Russian** - Blueberryy\n- **French** - Neerwan\n- **Brazilian Portuguese** - Eufranio\n\n\n\n\n--- \n\n# Contributing\n\nPull Requests and Issues are always welcome! Try to stick to templates where available but deviate if some components\ndon't apply. Detail is important when debugging an issue or trying to implement a new system however so prioritise\nthat!\n\nThanks for any help in advance! :)  -- I keep an eye out for Issues and PRs fairly regularly.\n",

Fast, one seat, medium difficulty.\n\n![Biplane](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/1cd4e2e5afa0bb45bc3622c7abfce47f14293794.jpeg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Airship\n\nSlower, but with two seats. Quite easy to maneuver, with acceptable speed thanks to the engine in the back.\n\n![Airship](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/d1e925cdcb7d4212c3ec688af6ab9017f8a2fde3.jpeg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Gyrodyne\n\nHuman-powered primitive dual seater. Trusty, yet neither the fastest nor the easiest to fly.\nNeeds a good initial push to get the rotor spinning.\nThe first one guessing my inspiration here can suggest one new (fitting) aircraft :)\n\n![Gyrodyne](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/f21c7ed0070043cfd12cb66afaa2cf8e04dbdab0.jpeg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Some items to tinker\n\nSince aircraft are generally more complex than, e.g. a boat, a handful of items has been added to make crafting aircraft feel more like actually assembling something.\n\n![Recipes](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/b483b7f43b2afab67e59f7c3e3f09dcfefd89b60.png)",

          "body": "## Overview\nData Driven Block and Item Revelation system. Discover as you go!\n\nRevelationary adds a way to gate the discovery of new blocks in the world via data pack, or API (for other mods).\nUsing Revelationary, you can design your packs / mods progression in a way the player does not feel overwhelmed when starting a new playthrough. They can only perceive these worldgen blocks when they unlocked a specific advancement, making the block visible for them.\n\nExample:\nThe player sees a specific ore as stone. As they defeat the enderdragon they can now see and mine your ore in the world - it was always there from the start. Individual for each player and very performant.\n\n## Revelations\n\"[a] revelation is the revealing or disclosing of some form of truth or knowledge\"\n\nIf you are the designer of a progression based mod or modpack you have come to the right place.\n\nWith Revelationary, you are able to use Data Packs or the Revelation API to gradually reveal blocks in the world as the player progresses. A plain stone filled cleft might be revealed as bursting with life and ore as the player defeats a boss or reaches an important milestone.\n\nAs long as a player does not have the necessary progress the blocks and items you register with Revelationary via API or Data Pack will just have cryptic names and in case of blocks in the world, will drop the same drops as the block it is disguised as, giving the player a seamless experience without getting flooded with unknown resources that they are not able to use at the start. Instead you can introduce resources just as they are needed.\n\n## Limitations\nBesides visuals and drops, disguised blocks retain all the properties of the original block: Hitbox, if light passes through and everything else. Keep that in mind when searching for fitting candidates. A perfect disguise for your Ore would be stone or deepslate, since these share a lot of similarities. Similarly you could disguise your elusive plant with a poppy: Both have a small hitbox and players can walk through them.\n\nIf you are a programmer you can use the Revelation API to dynamically change your blocks properties depending on if they are visible to the player, or not. This way you could even disguise your flower as air: Giving it an empty hitbox when disguised, your players might not even know it is there until they can see them!\n\n\nFind lots of examples for data packs & the API in Revelationary's wiki: https://github.com/DaFuqs/Revelationary/wiki\n\n## Registering Revelations via Data Pack\nHave to be placed in the folder `resources/data/<<mod_id>>/revelations`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"advancement\": \"spectrum:milestones/reveal_quitoxic_reeds\",\n  \"block_states\": {\n    \"minecraft:grass\": \"minecraft:beacon\",\n    \"minecraft:tall_grass\": \"minecraft:obsidian\",\n    \"minecraft:tall_grass[half=upper]\": \"minecraft:netherite_block\"\n  },\n  \"items\": {\n    \"minecraft:nether_star\": \"minecraft:gunpowder\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Registering a \"revelation aware\" block or item\n\n```java\npublic class CloakedItem extends Item implements RevelationAware {\n\t\n\tIdentifier cloakAdvancementIdentifier;\n\tItem cloakItem;\n\t\n\tpublic CloakedItem(Settings settings, Identifier cloakAdvancementIdentifier, Item cloakItem) {\n\t\tsuper(settings);\n\t\tthis.cloakAdvancementIdentifier = cloakAdvancementIdentifier;\n\t\tthis.cloakItem = cloakItem;\n\t\t\n\t\tregisterCloak();\n\t}\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic Identifier getCloakAdvancementIdentifier() {\n\t\treturn cloakAdvancementIdentifier;\n\t}\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic Hashtable<BlockState, BlockState> getBlockStateCloaks() {\n\t\treturn new Hashtable<>();\n\t}\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic Pair<Item, Item> getItemCloak() {\n\t\treturn new Pair<>(this, cloakItem);\n\t}\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onCloak() { }\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onUncloak() { }\n\t\n}\n```\n\n## Registering a Callback when Revelations happen\n\n```java\nRevelationHolder.registerRevelationCallback(new RevelationHolder.UncloakCallback() {\n    @Override\n    public void trigger(List<Identifier> advancements, List<Block> blocks, List<Item> items) {\n        for(Block block : blocks) {\n            if(Registry.BLOCK.getId(block).getNamespace().equals(MOD_ID)) {\n                ...\n                <I dunno. Like show a popup or something. You tell me>\n                ...\n                break\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\n# Discord\nYou will find a lot of helpful people on Spectrum's Discord.

Things you\nhave always noticed as being out of place, but have never been able to put your finger on because you have lacked the\nknowledge and tools to observe them. Now is the time!\n\nSpectrum is progression-based and tries not to give everything away at first glance.\nYour journey through its advancement trees will be cluttered by realizations, puzzles and lots of \"aaaaaah\"s.\nEach step of your journey will be hinted at through advancements and the in-game guidebook you receive as soon as you\nfind your first geode.\n\nThere is no hand-holding, so everything will require a fair bit of experimentation or exploration.\nThis also means that it may not be the best fit for everyone. Everyone plays Minecraft differently and that is perfectly\nfine!\n\n**_Spectrum is not meant to be rushed or grinded through. It is best played alongside your playthrough._**\n\n## Everything you ever wanted in a Magic Mod\n\n- handcrafted progression & revelation system\n- lots of new magical equipment, items, blocks, decorations\n- lots of new enchantments & potion effects\n- New fluids with full collision & unique effects\n- build your own, customizable crafting structures\n- lots of handcrafted new sounds and particles\n- new unique ores, plants and geodes\n- custom structures with intriguing puzzles\n\n![Item Showcase](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/93d47cbb91a93ca610013ef17893648e3865590b.png)\n\n## Revelations\n\nJust because something looks like stone doesn't mean it is...\n\n![Obscured Items](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/525879685786e1c53ac1d26f9ca9d88206e836ab.png)\n\nThere is a lot to uncover and lots of discoveries to be made.\n\n![Revelations](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/d18f44e516fd6d7fbe3d1c7217534bf709209629.png)\n\n## Is this mod for me?\n**You might enjoy Spectrum if you like the following:** Outer Wilds; Myst; Thaumcraft; Chromaticraft; figuring out how\nand why things work\n\n**You will probably hate Spectrum if you like the following:** Generic tech mod #7 with linear progression that tells\nyou exactly what to do at every step; following video tutorials 1:1\n\n# Progressing through the mod\n\nYou may notice that most items only show up with a locked recipe in your recipe viewer.\nIn Spectrum, recipes and their matching guidebook entries are unlocked step by step, giving you something new to toy\nwith, with each new discovery you made.\n\nEverything will be hinted at via advancements and the guidebook gifted to you when you stumble upon your first geode:\nyour own, personal notebook.\nEverything you stumble upon, every recipe you unlock, every discovery you make you will note there.\n\n![Guidebook](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/6490d0b59d852952022da1d0b73dad128829a50f.png)\n\n## New ways to craft\n\nSpectrum features lots of new ways to express yourself.\nIts multiblock structures are designed in a way to feel satisfying, fun to play with and to give you the opportunity to\nexpress your creativity by giving you lots of freedom on how to construct and personalize them.\n\n![Pedestal Crafting](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3rc31Hgo/images/557edb80e180b9b5a85aedd0fa2c673c310cbbf9.png)\n\n# Spectrum's Discord\nYou will find a lot of helpful people on Spectrum's Discord.\nThere are always friendly and helpful people around.\nFeel free to swing by if you like!\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/EXU9XFXT8a\n\n## Lots of room to tinker for modpack makers\n\nPretty much everything is configurable, from recipes to the whole progression path.\nSpectrum also comes with lots of new advancement criteria.\n\nThe full and extensive documentation for modpack makers is available\nin [Spectrum's Wiki](https://github.com/DaFuqs/Spectrum/wiki).\nPlayers will find everything they need in the extensive ingame guidebook.\n\n## Want to contribute?\n\nEvery single input and be it just feedback or a bug report is greatly appreciated!\n\n## Mod Integration\n- AE2: Lots of additional Recipes;

Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.\n\n**Botania's design philosophy**\n\n* No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;\n* No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n* No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;\n* Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n* Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\n**Botania's goals**\n\n* Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n* Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;\n* Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;\n* Create an overall immersive experience.\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Botania today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://botaniamod.net/index.html)**\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)- - ",
