          "body": "**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_HEADER.webp)**\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER1.webp)**\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is a mod that adds new and improved villages and pillager outposts to Minecraft.** It is available for both Forge and Fabric, and it works with most world-generation and structure mods. CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\nChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods. Full documentation is [here](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility)\n\nIt also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem.\nMods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n- **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n- **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n- **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default.\n- Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the CurseForge website.\n\nMod integration\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it's compatible. If it isn't yet, It will be. Read this [wiki page](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility) for details!\n\nYou can suggest more mods in my GitHub Issue section.\n</details>\n\n\n![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER5.webp)\n\n[![discord-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/discord-plural_64h.png)](https://discord.gg/JzYEw7PxQv) \n[![github-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/github-plural_64h.png)](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village) \n[![twitter-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/twitter-plural_64h.png)](https://twitter.com/ChoiceTheorem)\n[![youtube-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/youtube-plural_64h.png)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUSv0t-aWToQkpP5eonHmlA)\n\n**Credits**\n-----------\n\n*   Vichy0623 for codesigning the builds\n*   Robified for converting this datapack into a mod.\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_PROMO.webp)](https://bisecthosting.com/CT)",

In between continents are plenty of islands to keep your sailing interesting. When you spawn in your world, you are guarenteed to always spawn on a medium-sized continent, which averages around 1k blocks in size.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

This is important!\n\nThe version support numbers are strict! <br>\nIf a version says it supports MC 1.18.1 it will NOT work on 1.18.2! <br>\n\nAnd: the mod is still in alpha. Things may change, break, crash or otherwise go wrong. You have been warned! <br>\nAlthough if you have problems feel free to leave an issue on the project's GitLab.\n<br> \n \n\n \n## FAQ:\n\n**Q: Forge or Fabric?** <br>\nA: MC 1.20.6 and newer - NeoForge and Fabric are both in the same jar. <br>\nMC 1.20.4 and older - Forge and Fabric are both in the same jar. \n\n**Q: Shaders?** <br>\nA: Yes, but only with certain shaders. <br>\n- Optifine: DH partially works with forward rendered shaders.\n- Iris (and equivalent ports): DH 2.1.0+ only works with Iris 1.7+ and only with shaders built with DH support in mind. \n  - DH 2.0 and older don't work with Iris.\n\n**Q: Does this work with player created structures?** <br>\nA: Yes.\n\n**Q: Is there multiplayer support?** <br>\nA: Yes.\nAlthough currently the mod is only client side so you have to explore chunks for the mod to use them.\n\n<br>\n\n### Extended FAQ:\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/1-general/General\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-general.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/2-problems-and-solutions/Problems-and-Solutions\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-mod-support.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/4-mod-support/Mod-Support\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-problem.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a>\n\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Discord:\nJoin our Discord for news, updates, and help:\ndiscord.com/invite/xAB8G4cENx\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Support us:\n\nIf you want to help with development, join our discord and let us know!\n\nOtherwise if you can't help with development but still want to support Distant Horizons, check out our donation page:\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/distanthorizons",

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).\n\nThe downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods` folder.",

Helps in maintaining sanity :)<br><br>Initially created to hide the warning in my own development environment, and thought it couldn't hurt to release it as a feature for in production as well.

This is __not__ required, but it allows all items to have their own beautiful textures.\n- Incendium is **not** compatible with Amplified Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nIncendium adds 8 unique biomes to the nether. Do you bravely venture through the perilous **Quartz Flats**, wander the mysterious **Withered Forest**, or battle your way through the steep **Infernal Dunes**? Each biome has a unique personality and story to tell. With unique block themes in each biomes, opportunities for new farms for technical players, 3D biomes, and stunning terrain, there is truly something for everyone.\n\n### Structures\nTo compliment the lovely biomes, there are 9+ structures for you to explore and conquer. In the Ash Barrens, the **Foribdden Castle** stands forbodingly, with courageous Piglins defending its treasured loot - one of the largest and complex random structures in Minecraft! Alternatively, you can conquer the ominous **Sanctum** with its illagers defending dark secrets and strong weapons. The skeleton chef Torte defends his **Quartz Kitchen**, and the Withered Director his **Nether Reactor**. What will you conquer first?\n\n### Items\nEvery mob you defeat and structure you conquer has its reward - Incendium pays you handsomely with both rick loot and custom weapons! Defeating the Hovering Inferno could earn you the **Trailblazer** - a flame-spewing bow. A high damage, but taxing **Greatsword of Sacrifice** hides within the Forbidden Castle's walls, along with the helpful **Hefty Pickaxe**. Or maybe you prefer to find the **Hazmat Suit** to protect you from all types of poisonous attacks. There are over 25 items to forge your own playstyle with!\n\n### Mobs\nNo datapack would be complete without its own mobs to fight you. The Toxic Heap is home of the agile **Toxic Slimes**, and the Withered Forest is haunted by the **Restless Spirits**. On the other hand, you could go on a rescue missue to save the **Ghastling** from the Abandoned Tower - in return, it will defend you from Ghasts. If none of this is challenging, you can summon the all-powerful **Hovering Inferno** boss for a difficult and dirty battle.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

So many things broke in 1.20.5, and it was simply not worth my time. Thank you!\n\n- Updated to 1.20.5 (supports 1.20-1.20.6)\n- Now supports Neoforge\n- Scout's Battle Helm now uses an emerald Sentry trim\n- Custom banners and potions have been renamed, or given a name if there was not one already\n- Custom banners and potions are now split into their own loot tables for easier use\n- New particles for Necrotic and Radiation shields, and they should trigger their effects properly\n- In 1.20.5 only, Ghastling now appears as a mini-Ghast\n- Voltaic Trident should now work properly\n- Holy Wrath is removed from a loot table it shouldn't have been in\n- Fixed issue where Piglin Villagers would not move\n- Greatsword of Sacrifice's self-damage has been rebalanced\n- Restless Spirits *should* no longer starve to death\n- Fixed issue where a new marker entity would generate on every single world load\n- Fixed a malformed JSON strings that could spawm console on Spigot-based servers",

          "description": "Sodium addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo",
          "body": "Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.",

You against the void - nothing more than that.\nNullscape boosts the End's height to 384 blocks, and makes full use of 1.18's modern features to generate incredibly varied terrain. You'll find everything from shattered islands, to floating valleys, to crystallized peaks! Different regions of the End - on very large scales - have different properties and feelings to allow for almost infinite variation in terrain shapes. From sponge-like porous terrain, to stretched alien landscapes, to stacked rounded islands; you'll find new and interesting terrain no matter how far you go.\n__ __\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n",

Meaning that everything that's added is something which could also be built in vanilla creative.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nRoguelike Dungeons started as a project to enhance and build on the experience of the original Minecraft box style dungeons by linking rooms together with corridors and stairwells.\n\nThe design of these dungeons was inspired by the 404 Challenge, and Vechs' SuperHostile maps. Amnesia the Dark Descent inspired the tone and themes throughout.\n\nThe title comes from the genre of old dungeon crawlers by the same name.\n\n## Roguelike Challenge\n\nTry to enter a dungeon on your first day and don't leave until you've explored the entire structure. The loot and difficulty are designed to make this a rewarding experience.\n\n## Commands and Gamerules\n\nRoguelike Dungeons generate in the world naturally, however you can directly control the placement if you wish.\n\nThe \"roguelike\" command can be used to generate a dungeon at the caller's position by calling \"roguelike dungeon here\". This command will be expanded later.\n\nThe \"roguelikeDungeonsGenerate\" Gamerule (defaults to true) can be used to disable natural generation.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why beta? Is this mod stable?\nThis mod is stable as far as I know. I'll remove the beta status when core systems are no longer under construction. Soon.\n\n### How do I find the dungeon? Does locate work?\nThe locate command does not work because these dungeons are not generated as part of the vanilla structure system. You'll usually find them near villages, so locate those instead.\n\n### Can I add this mod to an existing world?\nYes. New dungeons will naturally spawn in new chunks. If you want to add a dungeon to old terrain you can do so using the \"roguelike\" command.\n\n### What happens if I remove this mod?\nNothing will break if you remove this mod after generating dungeons. Mob Spawners will no longer generate fancy mob equipment, and that's about it.\n\n### Do players who join a multiplayer world need to have this mod installed?\nNo. This mod is entirely vanilla compatible, and does not need to be installed on the client side.\n\n### Can I add this mod to a modpack?\nYes. Do whatever you like.\n\n### Can I change the loot?\nCurrently, no. Eventually I'll add a vanilla style loot table option.\n\n### Can I add my own rooms?\nNo, this dungeon is generated procedurally. It's not possible to add content without changing the source code. If it were easy to add this capability I would.\n",

          "body": "**This mod is the result of thousands of hours of development, and is made possible thanks to players like you.** If you would like to show a token of your appreciation for my work, and help support the development of Sodium in the process, then consider [buying me a coffee](https://jellysquid.me/donate).\n\n<a href=\"https://caffeinemc.net/donate\"><img src=\"https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3\" width=\"180\"/></a>\n\n---\n\n<center>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/5ca2e8f6c72f3d543dd3dc95b706964c5678d80e.png\" alt=\"Sodium 0.4 Comparison\"></img>\n <p>\n   <!-- This paragraph is load bearing, and ensures a margin is added before the following Markdown -->\n </p>\n</center>\n\nSodium is a powerful rendering engine and optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves performance and graphical quality. It boasts great compatibility with the wider mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is available for multiple mod loaders, but we recommend using [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) for the most simple and lightweight experience. If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed your mod loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.",

          "body": "![Tectonic logo](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/3797bb32f05af523d3ec2a76b6c3c4f9187fac50.png)\n\nWelcome to **Tectonic**, a world generation project that aims to transform how terrain is shaped.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nTectonic is available as a datapack and as a Fabric/Neoforge mod. Forge mod versions are discontinued starting with 1.20.5.\n\nIf you are using Terralith with Tectonic **as datapacks**, install [Terratonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terratonic) instead of Tectonic. If you are using the two projects **as mods**, you don't need to install anything extra.\n\n## Description\n\nTectonic makes several large, impactful changes to worldgen.\n\nFeatures labeled with 🎚️ can be toggled on and off in the mod version's config file.\n\n### Mountain Ranges\n\nThe way mountains generate has been completely overhauled, with them forming huge mountain ranges that can stretch for thousands of blocks. These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\nThe mod version's config file provides several options for customizing mountain generation:\n- `terrain_scale`: Vertically scales terrain, higher values = more extreme terrain heights\n- `horizontal_mountain_scale`: Horizontally scales mountains, lower values = less steep mountain slopes\n- `increased_height`: Enables a built-in datapack that increases the Overworld build and generation height to 640\n\n### Underground Rivers 🎚️\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn some steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as \"lerp\" issues - is gone. In previous Tectonic versions this meant that Windswept biomes were removed from generation, but in v2 and above they will once again generate.\n\n### Dunes 🎚️\n\nSmooth desert dunes will generate in some Desert biomes, giving Deserts a special look to them.\n\n### Deeper Oceans 🎚️\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!\n\nIf the mod version is installed, vanilla Ocean Monuments will generate deeper to compensate for the deeper oceans.\n",

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

          "body": "# Welcome to William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld for 1.20.1 and higher!\n\n![William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54945257/205379797-def647a9-8d28-4c90-80b9-08d8a4a0e082.png)\n\n## Introduction\nThis mod attempts to recreate the familiar landscapes you know and love in a way that creates a more realistic and atmospheric world.\n\n### Why are there now 2 WWOO versions?\nWe decided to split WWOO in two parts, one with new biomes added ([Expanded Exosphere](https://modrinth.com/mod/expanded-ecosphere)) and one which only overhauls existing biomes (WWOO).\n\n## Key Features\n### Overhauled Biomes\nEvery biome has been reworked to provide a more realistic and immersive environment. Say goodbye to the standard biomes and welcome an enhanced world filled with diverse landscapes and exciting adventures.\n\n### Biome Transitions\nDiscover the new transitions between biomes, that eliminate jarring shifts between environments, allowing for a more natural world flow. Check out this [example picture](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/II7t6llZ/images/415ed50637330b1c39d463076af7f2ab5fe9a283.png) in the Gallery.\n\n### Compatibility with Vanilla Clients\nWorried about compatibility issues with your friends? Fear not! Overhauled Overworld exclusively uses vanilla blocks, ensuring that you can install this mod on your server, and your friends can join with their vanilla clients. This makes for a hassle-free and enjoyable multiplayer experience.\n\n## Enhance Your Experience\n- **Navigable Rivers**: Improve your river experience with this travel-friendly add-on. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/navigable-rivers-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-2/)\n\n- **Cliffs and Coves**: Improve your world with better coastlines using this add-on. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/cliffs-and-coves-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-2/)\n\n- **Towering Tepuis**: Add a forbidding and mysterious area of adventure to your world. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towering-tepuis-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-4-1-20-6/)\n\nIf you prefer a datapack over a mod, click [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/4pbhwMQz) to download the datapack version of WWOO.\n\n\n## Join Our Community\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect with fellow adventurers, we invite you to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/yJng7sC44x).

Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work. Feel free to ask me any questions on Discord!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"http://sbisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3wUhXJJ.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Nether Fortresses is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-ocean-monuments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Ocean Monuments</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Witch Huts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-witch-huts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Witch Huts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li>Infernal Expansion, Better Nether & other Nether biome mods</li>\n<li>Apocalyptic Fortress: The AF fortress will spawn alongside the Better Fortress</li>\n<li>Bygone Nether: Better Fortresses will spawn instead of Bygone Nether's enhanced vanilla fortress</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it! Seriously!</p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3LW5j7DAdE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zMhFcqM.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better End Island is intended to be compatible with as many mods as possible.

Everything should still work properly though.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Progressive Bosses</b><ul><li>Extra cage placement may be a little scuffed in older versions of Progressive Bosses. Make sure you're on the latest version!</li><li><i>/end_island reset</i> command may not properly reset fight history/progress on Progressive Bosses' side of things. If you use this command, you should also run <i>/progressivebosses difficulty set <player> dragon 0</i></li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Better End</b><ul><li>Since the island is smaller than in vanilla, obsidian spikes will spawn closer to the center</li><li>If any spikes are missing or you have any other issues with generation, try using the <i>/end_island reset</i> command while in the End</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Nullscape</b><ul><li>Completely compatible on 1.19+. <b>Not compatible on 1.18.2.</b></li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Savage Ender Dragon</b><ul><li>The crystals Better End Island adds in the center may rarely respawn, if crystal respawning from Savage Ender Dragon is enabled.

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility. However, mods trying to change the same mechanics will never be compatible (such as dual wielding mods).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## 🤝 Partnerships\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWe partnered up with the following mods, to fully utilise the JSON API of Better Combat:\n\n- [MC Dungeons Weapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdw)\n\n- [MCDoom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdoom)\n\n- [MedievalWeapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/medievalweapons)\n\n- [Mythic Metals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mythicmetals)\n\n- [Simply Swords](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-swords)\n\n- [Spectrum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spectrum)",

You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.",

This is the same mod written by genandnic of [Wall Jump](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wall-jump-fabric), but it's for 1.19.4.\n\n<font size=\"10\">\nWall-to-wall platforming in Minecraft! \n</br></br>\n<font size=+1>\n\nWith this mod installed, players can perform new movements that will allow them to navigate their environment more dynamically.\n\nWall jumping allows players to jump off walls to gain additional height or reach areas that might otherwise be out of reach. To perform a wall jump, the player must jump towards a wall and then jump again off of the wall at the right moment. Timing is crucial, as the player must hit the wall at the correct angle and jump off at the right time to gain the maximum height.\n\nDouble jumping allows players to jump twice in quick succession, providing even more mobility and allowing them to reach even higher places. To perform a double jump, the player must jump once, then jump again while still in midair. This technique is helpful in reaching higher ledges or avoiding obstacles in the player's path.\n\nPlease see the following on how to do the various actions ingame!\n\n<b>Wall Cling</b>: Jump towards a wall and hold the wall jump key (LSHIFT). \n\n<b>Wall Jump</b>: While wall clinging, keep holding W and let go of LSHIFT to wall jump.\n\n<b>Double Jump</b>: Optional mid-air jump that you can use to your advantage.\n\n</font></font></font></font></center>",

Simply hold the \"excavate\" key(bound to ~ by default,configurable) while mining a block and all the connected blocks will be mined as well, saving you the time from mining each individually.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/fAD8Jrt4HVqn8BEHF2/giphy.gif \"\")\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/WTRhcX7JxVw2mpIiUW/giphy.gif \"\")\n\nDiggus Maximus is highly configurable, featuring:\n\n*   Automatically picking up the mined blocks\n*   maximum number of blocks to mine\n*   max distance from start block to spread\n*   the ability to excavate with your hand\n*   Tool durability\n*   Player exhaustion\n*   A blacklist/whitelist\n*  Auto stopping before tool breaks\n*  Support for mining BlockTags\n\nDiggus Maximus is required to be installed on both the client, and the server. While playing on a server, the server config will override the clients \n\n",
